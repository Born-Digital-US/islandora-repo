0,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,A culturally competent behavioral weight loss program for adult Latinos with a BMI >30kg/m2,38089,Latino||Obesity||Cultural Competency||Weight Loss,,2016-05-06,"This study answers the question, “In Adult Hispanic BMI ≥ 30 (P), how does development of a weight loss program that utilizes Motivational Interviewing (I) compared to counseling and educational materials only (C) affect weight loss over the period of three months (T).” There are limited published systematic reviews and randomized control trials to evaluate the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI), in conjunction with diet and exercise to promote weight loss. Participants (n = 5) were Latino patients of a local community health care center who were overweight and medically at risk due to unhealthy lifestyles that were determined through a screening test. The 4-week clinical pathway program used motivational interviewing in one-on-one sessions every other week, and implemented the “Your Heart, Your Life” curriculum the other weeks.  One expected outcome included lower anthropometric measurement numbers of participants’ WL, BMI, WC, and BP. Another expected outcome was an increase in physical activity. Participants were also expected to earn a higher score on a post-test about nutrition and healthy living. A paired t-test and power analyses were used to assess its effectiveness. Results indicated significant decrease in weight loss (t [5] = 3.68, p = .0211, Cohen’s dz=1.647). For heart healthy habits, there were significant increases all three categories: weight management (t [5] = - 3.36, p = .0211), cholesterol and fat (t [5] = - 3.138, p =.035, salt and sodium (t [5] = - 4.899, p = .008). In addition, there was an increase in knowledge (t [5] = - 4.000, p = .016).  Every participant showed small gains. Future implications should include more participants, including males, a control group, innovative activities that help to motivate a community of learners and more flexibility in allotted time for interventions.",,eng,,,Text,64 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2016-05-06 13:57:32.275451+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:23.947335+00:00,1,,,38089.0,,"Ledesma, Nadia","Thrall, Charlotte",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Despite the proven safety and value of PrEP treatment, use remains low in practice. Research has shown that low clinical use corresponds to low levels of understanding of PrEP among providers. Academic detailing is a method of innovation diffusion through provider education that results in changes in knowledge and practice. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of academic detailing on primary care provider knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to prescribe PrEP.<br/><br/>Methods: An academic detailing session was provided by the Florida Department of Health in Broward County to primary care providers (PCPs) at a private clinic in the Southeastern US. The Conceptual Model of Nursing and Population Health (CMNPH) and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services Framework (PARIHS) were used as guides for project design and evidence-based practice implementation. There were five participants in the academic detailing session including: a physician, a physician assistant (PA), and three medical students. PCP PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured using pre and post intervention surveys. PrEP prescription, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) screening, and HIV testing were measured using aggregate data queries for the time periods of four and eight weeks before and four and eight weeks after the educational intervention. No personal identifying information was obtained.<br/><br/>Results: Pre and post surveys were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank testing to examine differences between matched pairs of ordinal data. Significant PrEP screening and HIV/STI testing were analyzed pre and post intervention using paired t tests to compare pre and post intervention practices. Significant differences were found in the results (Z = 2.03, 1.84, and 1.83 respectively, p > 0.1) The academic detailing intervention significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers and medical students regarding PrEP. The mean of active qualifying ICD 10 codes prior to the intervention versus post intervention were 5 (sd = 5.64) vs. 4.2 (sd = 4.87) respectively. No significant difference was found between active ICD 10 codes for patient visits before compared to after the intervention (t (9) = 1.12, p>.1).<br/><br/>Conclusions: This project found that academic detailing improved provider self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding PrEP. However, self-reported survey scores were not correlated with changes in clinical practice based on ICD 10 codes.

4,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,A Walking Plan for Pregnant Women with Gestational Diabetes: A Feasibility Study,53969,Gestational Diabetes||Physical Activity||Walking,,2019-04-29,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a well-established predictor for the development of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life. The incidence of GDM has been on the rise over the past 30 years and is the leading co-morbidity during pregnancy (Ferrara, 2007). Physical activity (PA) in combination with nutritional therapy has been shown to achieve glycemic control in women with GDM and is therefore first line therapy for management (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology [ACOG], 2017; Center for Disease Control and Prevent [CDC], 2018). Recommendations for PA in pregnancy include 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise most days of the week (ACOG 2015; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2018).  Because of this, an innovative project was created to determine the feasibility of adding a walking plan into GDM care. Participants in the project received verbal and written instruction on an unsupervised structured walking plan set up for a beginner to gradually increase PA to the recommended time of 150 minutes per week for a total of four weeks.

Water safety is an important anticipatory guidance topic a primary care provider should be discussing at all well visits.  The Health Belief Model is an effective framework to guide family education interventions.

Additionally, providers were updated on water safety recommendations from the Center for Family Health and Safety at Phoenix Children’s Hospital.

Restrictive interventions place patients and healthcare staff in hostile situations that can lead to physical, mental, and emotional injuries that can last a lifetime. Unfortunately, restrictive interventions continue to be used in many healthcare organizations around the world and the<br/>number of patient and staff injuries continue to rise. Stakeholders at a Phoenix area psychiatric inpatient hospital conducted an internal audit on the number of seclusion and restraint episodes in 2019, which revealed an increase in the number of seclusion and restraints episodes on the adolescent unit. The result of this audit led to the project question: For nurses on an acute adolescent inpatient unit, is a seclusion and restraint education program more effective than usual<br/>practice in changing the knowledge and attitude regarding seclusion and restraint? The purpose of this practice change project was to provide staff education that focused on trauma informed care, de-escalation techniques, and therapeutic communication to improve staff confidence to ultimately lead to the reduction of seclusion and restraint use on an adolescent inpatient unit. A<br/>pre and posttest questionnaire designed to better understand nurse attitude and knowledge regarding restrictive interventions prior to the education session was provided. A convenience sample of nurses (N=9) participated in the project.

Unmanaged early onset adolescent mood disorders have an increased potential to result in suicide, the second leading cause of death in adolescents. Referring all patients with a positive depression screen to a mental health specialist creates treatment delay and burdens already limited community resources.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this primary care practice transformation was to improve pediatric primary care provider confidence and behavior to support and deliver evidence-based behavioral healthcare for adolescents with mild to moderate depression.\\n\\nMETHODS: An evidence-based adolescent depression education program was delivered to pediatric primary care providers in a small community setting. The program\u2019s components included measures to identify and manage mild to moderate depression. Outcome measures included: 1) provider knowledge, beliefs, and confidence measured pre- and post-intervention; and 2) electronic health record documentation of provider adherence to guideline recommendations one, two, and three months post-intervention.\\n\\nRESULTS: Four providers participated in the intervention. The mean total score for the provider beliefs and knowledge from a 5-point Likert scale demonstrated a positive increase after the intervention (14.75 vs. 23.25, p = .068). The mean total provider confidence score achieved near significance as well (12.25 vs. 21.75, p = .066).

13,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Advance Directive Advocacy: Empowering Homeless Clients to Express Their End-of-Life Wishes,38136,Homeless Persons||Advance Directives||Advance Care Planning||Patient Education||Education,,2016-05-07,"As Baby Boomers age, the number of older homeless patients facing end of life is increasing. Homeless individuals die of the same diseases as their domiciled counterparts, but they have distinct barriers to equitable end-of-life care, such as lack of regular medical care, a higher likelihood of comorbid serious mental illness and substance abuse, alienation from potential healthcare proxies, and specific fears related to dying.  Completion of an advance directive (AD) would address many of these barriers, as well as national goals of reducing medical costs associated with end of life care. A review of the literature indicates that homeless individuals, once educated on the purpose and significance of ADs, complete them at a higher rate than non-homeless people. Further, racial and ethnic disparities in document completion are minimized with educational interventions about an AD’s purpose. King’s Theory of Goal Attainment provides the theoretical basis for the application of such an intervention in the setting of a medical respite center and a day resource center that both serve the homeless.

14,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Advance Directives in Long-Term Care: Implementation of Five Wishes,48667,Advance Directives||Long-Term Care,,2018-05-04,"Background and Purpose The lack of an advance directive (AD) can predispose a person to an aggressive course of treatment despite their wishes. When AD’s are incomplete, the chances of unwanted procedures, such as tube feedings and repeated transitioning between nursing homes and hospitals often result in the risk of increased mortality and morbidity, especially for older adults. Making end-of-life decisions can improve the quality of death by allowing individuals to make decisions to die in a dignified manner. The purpose of this project was to improve AD completion rates by implementing “Five Wishes” (FW) into the admission process in a long-term care facility (LTCF).<br/><br/>Methods The project took place on the skilled nursing units at a LTCF in Southwestern Arizona over a 2-month period of time. Twenty random charts were assessed before the start of the project to determine the residents AD status. Those 20 were then informed about FW’s and encouraged to complete one, along with all newly admitted residents to the skilled nursing units. Logs were used for data collection and each participating resident signed a HIPPA document. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and outcome variables.<br/>Outcomes Of the 20 current residents included in the quantitative chart assessment, 6 (30%) residents completed a FW’s document. Fifty residents were admitted during the project span and 21 (42%) of them completed FW’s.<br/><br/>Conclusions The FW’s completion rates were lower than expected. None of the residents had an AD more detailed than a basic full code or do not resuscitate (DNR) status before being informed of FW’s. It is recommended that the facility social workers would have implemented the intervention to increase the likelihood of adherence.",,eng,,,Text,29 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2018-05-15 19:50:39.733969+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:24.519918+00:00,1,kpardon1,,48667.0,,"Mickey, Lexi L.","Johannah, Uriri-Glover",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that 21-33% of all ED visits are non-emergent and increased age correlates with increased use of Pre-hospital EMS systems and emergency rooms. This study aimed to determine if an advance practice nurse (APN) in an older adult pre-hospital setting could reduce the use of 911 for non-urgent calls and transports, using the para-medicine model of care. Available evidence demonstrated a decrease in non-urgent transports with potential for significant savings to the healthcare system. This study was conducted in a community where 86.3% of residents are over the age of 65. The local fire department employed a full time APN who evaluated patients identified by EMS crews as at risk for repeat use of the 911 system. Following a 911 call and a referral by medics, the APN contacted patients to arrange a home visit. The purpose served to evaluate current health status, risks, and gaps in care. Interventions included assistance reducing safety concerns, assistance with coordination of care, and working with patient primary care providers to meet patient needs. Data collection included patient age, gender, number of 911 calls 30 days prior and 30 days post intervention, number of ambulance transports following intervention and PEI score after the initial APN visit. Six patients (32%) accepted the intervention and 13 or (68%) refused the intervention, with a mean age of 86 years of age. Wilcoxin signed rank test indicates the number of pre-intervention 911 calls was statistically significantly higher than the number of post-intervention 911 calls. Z= -2.23, Asymp. Sig.

A Fisher’s exact test and Pearson’s Chai squared test did not demonstrate a statistical significance in the number of ambulance transports, which could be attributed to the low participation rate in the intervention (n=6).

This study was conducted in a community where 86.3% of residents are over the age of 65. The local fire department employed a full time APN who evaluated patients identified by EMS crews as at risk for repeat use of the 911 system. Following a 911 call and a referral by medics, the APN contacted patients to arrange a home visit. The purpose served to evaluate current health status, risks, and gaps in care. Interventions included assistance reducing safety concerns, assistance with coordination of care, and working with patient primary care providers to meet patient needs. Data collection included patient age, gender, number of 911 calls 30 days prior and 30 days post intervention, number of ambulance transports following intervention and PEI score after the initial APN visit. Six patients (32%) accepted the intervention and 13 or (68%) refused the intervention, with a mean age of 86 years of age.

Readmissions can be reduced or prevented by providing a safe transition through care coordination and enhanced communication. Research demonstrates implementation of APRN led home visits (HV) along with telephonic follow-up are cost effective and can be utilized for reducing readmissions among HF patients.<br/><br/>Methods: A program was designed with an ACO and carried out in a family practice clinic with a group of seven HF patients older than 50 years who were at risk of readmission. Interventions included weekly HV with supplemental telephonic calls by the APRN student along with a physician assistant for 12 weeks. Readmission data was collected. QOL and SCB were measured using “Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire” (MLHFQ) and “European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale” respectively. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Friedman Test.<br/><br/>Outcomes: There were no hospital readmissions at 30 days and the interventions demonstrated a positive effect on QOL, self-care management and satisfaction (χ2 = 30.35, p=.000).

Improved outcomes occur in all health literacy levels in other diseases with the use of literacy-sensitive educational interventions that incorporate more than one literacy strategy over multiple sessions. To examine the effectiveness of a literacy-sensitive wound education intervention on wound knowledge and self-care, an evidence-based pilot project was conducted in an urban wound clinic. A convenience sample of 21 patients received a literacy-sensitive wound education intervention consisting of spoken and written communication over several sessions. Instruments measured health literacy level, wound knowledge, dressing performance, and wound healing status. There was a significant increase in wound knowledge scores in all literacy groups from baseline to visit two (p < .01) and four (p < .01). Dressing performance scores remained consistently high through visit four in all literacy levels. All participant’s wounds progressed toward wound healing significantly from baseline to visit two (p < .01) and four (p < .01).

Little evidence of health literacy effects on wound patients is available nor are literacy-sensitive educational interventions that address wound knowledge and self-care. Improved outcomes occur in all health literacy levels in other diseases with the use of literacy-sensitive educational interventions that incorporate more than one literacy strategy over multiple sessions. To examine the effectiveness of a literacy-sensitive wound education intervention on wound knowledge and self-care, an evidence-based pilot project was conducted in an urban wound clinic. A convenience sample of 21 patients received a literacy-sensitive wound education intervention consisting of spoken and written communication over several sessions.

Healthcare professionals are among the most stressed of any profession, and mental health workers are at an extremely high risk for burnout and compassion fatigue (Christopher & Meris, 2010) with an estimated 21% to 67% of mental health workers reporting that they experience high levels of burnout (Salyers et al., 2011). After researching the literature, it was evident that practicing mindfulness can lead to less stress and higher job satisfaction. In an effort to combat this problem, an on-site mindfulness intervention was implemented at an outpatient psychiatric setting for eight weeks. Twenty-seven mental health workers gave their consent to be part of the study, and eleven were able to complete the study and self-assessment surveys for three time periods. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (the Human Service Version) and a 1-item job satisfaction were used to measure the effect of intervention on employees’ levels of stress and job satisfaction. A non-parametric Friedman test of differences among repeated measures was conducted and findings were not significant when comparing the average total scores of means between pre-, post-, or 1-month follow-up for Emotional Exhaustion (p = .148), Depersonalization (p = .223), Personal Achievement (p = .784) and job satisfaction (p = .422).

Depression is a common reason for this underutilization and may coexist in up to 48% of patients.

24,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Caring for the Caregiver,54072,Caregivers||Gap Analysis,,2019-04-30,"Background: As the nation’s population ages and the prevalence of chronic diseases, like dementia, increases, informal caregivers will play an increasingly important role in maintaining independence for the elderly. Informal caregivers provide most long-term care for the elderly in this country and save hundreds of billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. However, most informal caregivers experience burden secondary to caregiving that adversely impacts their physical, social, and/or psychological health. Caregiver burden threatens caregiver health and contributes to institutionalization of care recipients. Since the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) model of care delivery relies heavily on informal caregivers to maintain independent aging, understanding and meeting the needs of caregivers is essential to the sustainability and success of PACE programs. <br/><br/>Purpose: This evidence-based practice (EBP) project was a gap analysis that surveyed 156 caregivers at an urban PACE program in the Midwest to examine caregiver demographics, caregiver burden, caregiver interest in support services, and the relationship between these variables to guide the development of caregiver programs. <br/><br/>Methods: Caregiver Assessments were administered to 156 caregivers via telephone or in person. The assessment included caregiver demographics, interest in caregiver services, and the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) to assess caregiver burden. The ZBI-12 has good reliability and validity as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 and a correlation with the full version ZBI scores of 0.95. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Pearson r correlation test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Mann-Whitney U test on SPSS version 25. This project was approved by the Arizona State University IRB.  <br/><br/>Results/Outcomes: Of 171 eligible informal caregivers of program participants living outside of an institution, 156 completed the survey, 3 refused, and 12 were unreachable. Most informal caregivers surveyed were Caucasian (69.5%) females (66%), children of the care recipients (45.5%), caring for people with dementia (40.6%), with some college education (37.2%), who earned $10,000-$25,000 annually (38.7%), provided over 30 hours of care per week (55.8%), and averaged 61.4 years old (SD=7.7). The average ZBI-12 score was 12.15 (SD=9.04), indicating a moderate level of burden. The most common stressors indicated by caregivers were activities of daily living (ADL) assistance (63.5%) and the time commitment involved in caregiving (57.7%). Correlates to high burden score included: limited time, aggressive behavior, financial stress, grief, assistance with ADLs, wandering behavior, toileting assistance/incontinence, and lack of sleep. Respite care was identified by 42.9% of those surveyed as the most helpful resource provided by PACE. 55.1% and 50.6% of caregivers indicated an interest in educational sessions and support groups respectively, if these services were offered in the future.  <br/><br/>Conclusion: Through the exploration of caregiver demographics, factors correlated to increased burden, and caregiver interest in support services, the results from this EBP project provide guidance to programs, particularly other PACE programs, seeking to proactively mitigate caregiver burden through support services. The results indicate that respite care, educational sessions, and support groups should be prioritized when developing informal caregiver support services.",,eng,,,Text,68 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,Public,,2019-06-06 22:51:37.755129+00:00,2019-06-06 22:51:38.281271+00:00,1,kpardon1,,54072.0,,"Craft-Otterbacher, Erin","Nunez, Diane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Caregiver burden threatens caregiver health and contributes to institutionalization of care recipients. Since the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) model of care delivery relies heavily on informal caregivers to maintain independent aging, understanding and meeting the needs of caregivers is essential to the sustainability and success of PACE programs. \\n\\nPurpose: This evidence-based practice (EBP) project was a gap analysis that surveyed 156 caregivers at an urban PACE program in the Midwest to examine caregiver demographics, caregiver burden, caregiver interest in support services, and the relationship between these variables to guide the development of caregiver programs. \\n\\nMethods: Caregiver Assessments were administered to 156 caregivers via telephone or in person. The assessment included caregiver demographics, interest in caregiver services, and the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) to assess caregiver burden. The ZBI-12 has good reliability and validity as indicated by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.88 and a correlation with the full version ZBI scores of 0.95. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Pearson r correlation test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Mann-Whitney U test on SPSS version 25. This project was approved by the Arizona State University IRB.  \\n\\nResults/Outcomes: Of 171 eligible informal caregivers of program participants living outside of an institution, 156 completed the survey, 3 refused, and 12 were unreachable. Most informal caregivers surveyed were Caucasian (69.5%) females (66%), children of the care recipients (45.5%), caring for people with dementia (40.6%), with some college education (37.2%), who earned $10,000-$25,000 annually (38.7%), provided over 30 hours of care per week (55.8%), and averaged 61.4 years old (SD=7.7). The average ZBI-12 score was 12.15 (SD=9.04), indicating a moderate level of burden. The most common stressors indicated by caregivers were activities of daily living (ADL) assistance (63.5%) and the time commitment involved in caregiving (57.7%). Correlates to high burden score included: limited time, aggressive behavior, financial stress, grief, assistance with ADLs, wandering behavior, toileting assistance/incontinence, and lack of sleep. Respite care was identified by 42.9% of those surveyed as the most helpful resource provided by PACE. 55.1% and 50.6% of caregivers indicated an interest in educational sessions and support groups respectively, if these services were offered in the future.  \\n\\nConclusion: Through the exploration of caregiver demographics, factors correlated to increased burden, and caregiver interest in support services, the results from this EBP project provide guidance to programs, particularly other PACE programs, seeking to proactively mitigate caregiver burden through support services. The results indicate that respite care, educational sessions, and support groups should be prioritized when developing informal caregiver support services.'}], 'subject': ['Caregivers', 'Gap Analysis'], 'extent': ['68 pages'], 'type': ['Text'], 'language': ['eng'], 'title': ['Caring for the Caregiver'], 'created': '2019-04-30', 'contributor': [{'last': 'Craft-Otterbacher', 'rest': 'Erin', 'roles': ['Author']}, {'last': 'Nunez', 'rest': 'Diane', 'roles': ['Mentor']}]}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2019-06-06T22:51:37.796Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

The purpose of this project was to determine if educating elementary school personnel would improve their knowledge and self-efficacy in caring for students with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and improve the health and educational outcomes of students with this disease.<br/>Background. Evidence suggests that teachers play a big role in the management of students with chronic illnesses. However, current literature indicates that teachers lack basic knowledge about childhood chronic illnesses and how to manage students with chronic illnesses. Synthesis of evidence indicated that an online CF educational intervention would improve knowledge and self-efficacy among school personnel, thereby improving the health and educational outcomes of students with CF.<br/>Methods. Elementary school personnel in Southern Arizona were asked to do an online pre-survey to evaluate knowledge and self-efficacy, view a short presentation on cystic fibrosis, and complete a post-survey. Parents of students with CF were asked to track 504 plan use and CF related absences. Frequencies were used to evaluate participant demographic data and survey data. The McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Test were used to analyze survey data.<br/>Results. Analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in perceived knowledge (p = .024) and self-efficacy scores (p = .034). Although survey scores showed an average score improvement between pre-survey and post-survey total scores (p = .212), it was not statistically significant.<br/>Conclusion.

Research involving non-behavioral health nurses, and medical and nursing students, sought to identify bias and negative attitudes directed towards psychiatric patients in a non-psychiatric setting. Studies were reviewed to determine the effects of educational interventions to teach empathy and increase knowledge related to the pathology of, and treatment modalities for, psychiatric patients. Several scales were used to measure bias and rate interventions to minimize it. Studies found that healthcare personnel, including nurses, are considered by mental health consumers to be primary contributors to stigma and discrimination against those with mental illness. The studies also discovered that participation in an educational intervention to learn empathy and acquire knowledge about psychiatric patients directly decreased bias. The project utilized the evidence-based practice PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PPM) supported by Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Combining the PPM with the SCT is supported in the literature as they both rely on learned behavior. Moving forward, the presentation was completed and participation sought.

Included in this category are those patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Functional GI issues are an important public health concern as they are becoming increasingly more common; they can be disabling and can cause significant socioeconomic burden in regard to health care costs, productivity and disability. There is strong evidence that probiotics have the potential to reduce IBS symptoms. Unfortunately, probiotics are underutilized in the clinical setting.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to increase knowledge and self-efficacy in patients with functional GI symptoms regarding the use of probiotics for symptom management. Patients in an outpatient GI practice in Southwestern United States with chronic functional GI symptoms were shown an educational video regarding the origins and benefits of using probiotics to manage chronic symptoms. Knowledge of probiotics, self-efficacy and willingness to utilize probiotics was measured by asking participants to complete a modified Health Belief Model survey before and after viewing the video. Patient demographics were collected. There were 75 participants (n=75) who participated in the project with a mean age of 40.3 years (SD=15.41), 85% female and 15% male. Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze changes in paired data with significant improvements in self-efficacy (Z=3.93, p< .01), benefits of probiotic use (Z=4.33, p<.01) and decreased barriers to probiotics use (Z=-4.31, p<.01). After participants viewed the educational video, 95% of patients indicated they would try probiotics (CI 95%, p<.01) versus 65% of patients who would try probiotics before viewing video. In conclusion, education regarding using probiotics to manage functional GI symptoms improved patient’s self-efficacy and their willingness to use probiotics to manage their symptoms.

Functional GI issues are an important public health concern as they are becoming increasingly more common; they can be disabling and can cause significant socioeconomic burden in regard to health care costs, productivity and disability. There is strong evidence that probiotics have the potential to reduce IBS symptoms. Unfortunately, probiotics are underutilized in the clinical setting.\\n\\nThe purpose of this project is to increase knowledge and self-efficacy in patients with functional GI symptoms regarding the use of probiotics for symptom management. Patients in an outpatient GI practice in Southwestern United States with chronic functional GI symptoms were shown an educational video regarding the origins and benefits of using probiotics to manage chronic symptoms. Knowledge of probiotics, self-efficacy and willingness to utilize probiotics was measured by asking participants to complete a modified Health Belief Model survey before and after viewing the video. Patient demographics were collected. There were 75 participants (n=75) who participated in the project with a mean age of 40.3 years (SD=15.41), 85% female and 15% male.

Paired education on diet and activity has been effective for persons from diverse races, ethnicities, and levels of education. For this project, the paired education focused on the dietary guidance of the Whole 30 plan and the current exercise/activity recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The ADA recommends 30 min 5 x week or 60 min 3 x week of exercise, with no more than 48 hours between exercise occurrences. Ten adults with HbA1C between 5.7%-6.4%, levels specified by the ADA as prediabetes, were invited to participate in the project at an outpatient wellness practice. Participants took a pretest on basic food and activity knowledge, received educational sessions on the Whole 30™ plan and activity recommendations from the ADA, then completed a posttest. Participants were scheduled for one month follow ups. At the 3 month follow up appointment, repeat HbA1C was drawn. Most of the patients (7/10) completed return appointments at the 3-month time frame. Statistically significant results were seen in diet and exercise knowledge using a paired T-test.

37,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Equine Assisted Learning: An Evidence-Based Intervention for Families,54066,Equine-Assisted Therapy||Mental Health||Family,,2019-05-02,"Background: It is estimated that 50% of all mental illness arises prior to age 14, an incident attributed in part to disruptions and imbalances within the family system. Equine assisted learning is a complementary and alternative approach to family therapy which is being used increasingly to promote mental health in both adults and children. This study sought to build and deliver an evidence-based, family-centered equine assisted learning program aimed at promoting family function, family satisfaction and child social-emotional competence, and to measure its acceptability and preliminary effect. <br/><br/>Method: Twenty families with children 10 years and older were recruited to participate in a 3-week equine assisted learning program at a therapeutic riding center in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions included groundwork activities with horses used to promote life skills using experiential learning theory. The study design included a mixed-method quasi-experimental one-group pretest posttest design using the following mental health instruments: Devereaux Student Strengths Assessment, Brief Family Assessment Measure (3 dimensions), and Family Satisfaction Scale to measure child social-emotional competence, family function, and family satisfaction, respectively. Acceptability was determined using a Likert-type questionnaire with open-ended questions to gain a qualitative thematic perspective of the experience. <br/><br/>Results: Preliminary pretest and posttest comparisons were statistically significant for improvements in family satisfaction (p = 0.001, M = -5.84, SD = 5.63), all three domains of family function (General Scale: p = 0.005, M = 6.84, SD = 9.20; Self-Rating Scale: p = 0.050, M = 6.53, SD = 12.89; and Dyadic Relationship Scale: p = 0.028, M = 3.47, SD = 7.18), and child social-emotional competence (p = 0.015, M = -4.05, SD 5.95). Effect sizes were moderate to large (d > 0.5) for all but one instrument (Self-Rating Scale), suggesting a considerable magnitude of change over the three-week period. The intervention was highly accepted among both children and adults. Themes of proximity, self-discovery, and regard for others emerged during evaluation of qualitative findings. Longitudinal comparisons of baseline and 3-month follow-up remain in-progress, a topic available for future discussion.<br/><br/>Discussion: Results help to validate equine assisted learning as a valuable tool in the promotion of child social-emotional intelligence strengthened in part by the promotion of family function and family satisfaction. For mental health professionals, these results serve as a reminder of the alternatives that are available, as well as the importance of partnerships within the community. For therapeutic riding centers, these results help equine professionals validate their programs and gain a foothold within the scientific community. Additionally, they invite future riding centers to follow course in incorporating evidence into their programs and examining new directions for growth within the mental health community.",,eng,,,Text,70 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,Public,,2019-05-31 23:00:58.198240+00:00,2019-05-31 23:00:58.969736+00:00,1,kpardon1,,54066.0,,"Solarz, Allison,","Chen, Angela",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Low health literacy is associated with misuse of healthcare resources and misunderstanding of healthcare teaching. Education has demonstrated efficacy in improving health literacy. A personalized educational program was provided to parents of Head Start children, offered in Spanish and English, and at a 3rd to 5th education level.<br/><br/>Design: Using an established program for health literacy education, a Doctor of Nursing Practice project was implemented. The effect the program had on increasing the health literacy of participants over a period of 4 weeks was examined. The predominately, Latina participants received three hours of instruction based upon the health literacy book “What to do When Your Child Gets Sick”.<br/><br/>Setting and Subjects: The educational program took place in a large, urban county in the Southwestern United States with 24 parents of preschool age children in Head Start.<br/><br/>Intervention: The educational program contained three hours of classroom instruction utilizing PowerPoint® presentation, demonstration, and teach-back techniques on how to care for a child’s healthcare needs.<br/><br/>Measures and Analysis: Pre-, post- and telephone surveys were used to assess the impact of the health literacy educational program. Wilcoxon and Freidman tests were used to interpret the results.<br/><br/>Results: Despite no significant increases in health literacy post implementation, participants’ remarked that they felt the class was helpful and wanted to share the information with friends and family.

42,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Health Promotion Education for Overweight and Obesity in Adults with Endocrine Disorders,38107,Health Promotion||Obesity||Endocrine System Diseases||Patient Education||Nutrition||Physical Activity,,2016-05-06,"Purpose: The purpose of this project was to implement health promotion education for overweight and obese adults with endocrine disorders. The overarching goal was to change dietary intake and improve exercise to reduce the incidence, prevalence, and impact of comorbidities associated with obesity. Background/Synthesis: Obesity is a significant epidemic facing the nation today with multiple impacts on the national healthcare system. There is often an association between obesity and endocrine disorders such as type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Both obesity and diabetes cost the nation billions of dollars annually in healthcare costs. Evidence shows that lifestyle modifications related to nutrition and physical activity are effective in weight reduction and prevention of chronic disease, especially when given by a healthcare provider. Methods: Fifteen adult patients at an endocrinology office in Arizona received individual counseling using the teach-back method focusing on health promotion behaviors through nutrition and exercise with a two-week follow-up phone call. Short-term outcomes measured in this project included changes in dietary intake and exercise behaviors through a pre- and post-test adapted from an obesity-screening tool developed by Greenwood et al. (2008). Outcomes/Results: Participants were primarily Caucasian and Hispanic, married, female, average age of 50 years, average BMI of 34.5, and some college education. There was a statistically significant increase in health promoting behavior on posttest scores (M=66, SD=6.23, range=58-76) compared to pretest scores (M=61, SD=4.72, range=50-66), t(14)=-2.55, p=0.023. Conclusions and Implications: Overall, patient health promotion behaviors increased with this educational intervention. Clinical implications include a potential decrease in patient comorbidities related to overweight and obesity. Implications for the greater healthcare system include decreased comorbidities, utilization of healthcare resources, and costs associated with overweight and obesity. Future recommendations would include determining weight and BMI changes over a longer period of time for even better outcome measures.<br/>	Keywords: obesity, obese, overweight, health promotion, health education, diet, exercise, nutrition",,eng,,,Text,55 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0,Public,2018-05-01,2016-05-06 21:56:43.998605+00:00,2018-06-21 18:47:52.350306+00:00,3,,,38107.0,,"DeVeau, Kristina","Velasquez, Donna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

General knowledge about the disease and its risk factors and prevention are significant variables to adopt health-promoting behaviors.  Lifestyle change intervention has been shown to be effective with the risk reduction behaviors in prediabetic population.

They received follow-up phone calls weekly for 4 weeks.  Demographics, PA, EH and SE levels were measured before the education session.  During the fourth week, PA, EH and SE were measured again.

Undiagnosed, uncontrolled diabetes in pregnancy can lead to maternal and infant health comorbidities as well as have adverse long-term effects for mother or baby. Although routine screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs between 24 and 28 weeks gestation, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends screening earlier in pregnancy for women at risk for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Risk factors include previous history of GDM, known impaired glucose metabolism, or obesity (BMI > 30). The purpose of this project is to implement the clinical practice guideline for early maternal glucose screening during pregnancy in women with risk factors through the integration of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool in an electronic health record (EHR). CDS tools can be utilized as a point of care strategy to remind providers of the clinical practice guidelines and to assist providers in decision-making related to screening.

48,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Implementation of a Family-based Obesity Intervention Within a Pediatric Primary Care,50051,Obesity||Childhood Obesity||Family||Lifestyle Intervention,,2018-05-02,"Background<br/>Apprxoimately 1in 5 U.S. school-aged children are obese.  There are many known health complications associated with obesity including premature death.  Family-based obesity interventions that promote healthy lifestyle habits are effective at enabling children to make changes needed to avoid long-term health complications associated with obesity.  The purpose of this evidence-based practice intervention was to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-based obesity intervention on familial lifestyle behaviors related to nutrition, physical activity, and screen time.<br/><br/>Methods<br/>Two overweight-obese children (according to CDC criteria) ages 8-12 years old visiting a pediatric primary care clinic in a suburban neighborhood located in the southwest region were recruited to participate in this evidence-based practice intervention based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Familial lifestyle behaviors were assessed using the Family Health Behavior Scale (FHBS) prior to receiving an educational intervention addressing nutritional, physical activity, and screen time recommendations and again after following these recommendation for 6-weeks.  Additionally, scheduled follow-up phone calls were made every 3 or 6-weeks addressing any parental questions that surfaced.  Data was insufficient for statistical analysis, however, anecdotal recommendations for future implementation of this intervention resulted.<br/><br/>Results<br/>Of the two patients who participated, pre- and post-intervention data was only attainable from one patient.  That patient did have improved scores within each of the 4 FHBS subscales (parent behaviors, physical activity, mealtime routines, and child behaviors).  Overall, 11 of the 27 behaviors assessed improved, 12 behaviors resulted in no change, and 4 behaviors worsened.  Recommendations related to a more successful implementation of this intervention in the futurre include improved provider pariticpation (buy-in), utiliazation of broader inclusion criteria, consideration of the implementation time-frame, and application of the Health Belief Model for addressing existing barriers for each patient prior to implementing the intervention.<br/><br/>Conclusions<br/>In order to determine the effectiveness of this intervention a larger sample size and completed post-intervention data are needed.

The 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention aims to improve the area of clinical prevention. Emergency departments (ED) play a key role in addressing this effort as they have multiple opportunities to connect with patients who are at risk. There exists a high-risk period of time immediately following a patient’s discharge from emergency care. To address this period of concern, a review of the literature was conducted on the effectiveness of follow-up contacts as a means to prevent suicide and suicide related attempts in this at-risk population. Based on this review, a follow-up intervention was proposed to increase patients’ social support and knowledge on suicide prevention through a safety plan and the use of caring postcards. The aim was to evaluate the degree to which implementation of a safety plan and follow-up using postcards reduces suicide risk in the ED. ED suicide prevention practices such as safety planning and caring contacts with postcards have shown to be feasible and cost-effective methods to reduce patients’ risk of suicide as they provide education and address the high-risk period of time after discharge. Using a quasi-experimental pre and post-test design, English speaking adults 18 years of age and older, admitted to an ED in the Phoenix Metropolitan area with suicidal ideation, were voluntarily recruited for two weeks. The self-rated Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used as a baseline assessment along with the introduction of a safety plan. Participants were then followed with the receipt of postcards with caring messages over a two-week period, and a final SBQ-R. The SBQ-R has shown beneficial reliability and validity measuring suicidality in the adult population. Data from the pre-SBQ-R was analyzed using descriptive statistics as no post-SBQ-Rs were received. Outcomes for this project included a reduction in suicidal ideation and suicide risk.

The 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention aims to improve the area of clinical prevention. Emergency departments (ED) play a key role in addressing this effort as they have multiple opportunities to connect with patients who are at risk. There exists a high-risk period of time immediately following a patient\u2019s discharge from emergency care. To address this period of concern, a review of the literature was conducted on the effectiveness of follow-up contacts as a means to prevent suicide and suicide related attempts in this at-risk population. Based on this review, a follow-up intervention was proposed to increase patients\u2019 social support and knowledge on suicide prevention through a safety plan and the use of caring postcards. The aim was to evaluate the degree to which implementation of a safety plan and follow-up using postcards reduces suicide risk in the ED. ED suicide prevention practices such as safety planning and caring contacts with postcards have shown to be feasible and cost-effective methods to reduce patients\u2019 risk of suicide as they provide education and address the high-risk period of time after discharge. Using a quasi-experimental pre and post-test design, English speaking adults 18 years of age and older, admitted to an ED in the Phoenix Metropolitan area with suicidal ideation, were voluntarily recruited for two weeks. The self-rated Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used as a baseline assessment along with the introduction of a safety plan. Participants were then followed with the receipt of postcards with caring messages over a two-week period, and a final SBQ-R.

59,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Improving Oral Health in Pregnancy,48353,Pregnancy||Oral Health||Dental Care||Screening,,2018-04-24,"Maintaining good oral health during pregnancy is a significant contributor to healthy pregnancy outcomes. The physiological changes that happen during pregnancy can adversely affect women’s oral health and place her at risk for pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage and preeclampsia. The unborn child’s health can also be affected by premature birth and low birth weight. Although professional organizations have evidence-based practice guidelines for both prenatal and dental providers, the evidence shows a gap between recommendations and practice.

61,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Improving Postpartum Follow-Up Through Enhanced Prenatal Education and Concurrent Scheduling with a One-Month Well Baby Visit,43899,Pregnancy||Patient Education||Postpartum Period||Contraception,,2017-05-01,"Stress of transitioning to parenthood, hormonal fluctuations as well as physical changes, and complications during postpartum could be addressed at the routine postpartum follow-up visit to avoid long-term adverse effects. While emphasis on preconception and prenatal care has increased nationwide, attendance at this important visit is on the decline. The purpose of this project was to investigate how enhanced prenatal education and concurrent scheduling of a well-baby visit at four weeks, instead of the traditional six weeks, could increase adherence to recommended follow-up care at a federally qualified health clinic in the Southwestern United States. The Theory of Reasoned Action guided the intervention while Rosswurum and Larrabee’s evidence-based practice model was used to develop the project. The pre-existing weekly prenatal education program was enhanced with information regarding the importance of a four-week postpartum follow-up visit. Front desk schedulers were educated to offer same day appointments for the postpartum care visit and one-month well-baby appointment. Data collection took place for three months after implementation of the project and was compared to adherence rates during the three months prior to the intervention. Providers and scheduling staff members participated in a short post-intervention interview. Prenatal education and convenience of concurrent scheduling increased the percentage of adherence to follow-up visits over a three-month period.

64,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening in the Primary Care Setting,50064,Screening||Cancer||Colorectal Cancer||Primary Care||Meaningful Use,,2018-05-05,"Purpose:  The purpose of this project was to implement a change in workflow to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates and improve Meaningful Use scores in a primary care setting.<br/><br/>Background and Significance: CRC is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among men and women.  Current CRC screening rates remain low, even with advanced screening options available.  Meaningful Use sets specific objectives for health care providers to achieve.  Documenting CRC screening status and recommending CRC screenings to patients is one of the objectives of Meaningful Use and is considered a Clinical Quality Measure (HealthIT.gov).  Factors that lead to CRC screening include primary care providers (PCPs) raising the topic, involving support staff, involving patients in the decision-making process, and setting alerts in electronic health records (EHRs).<br/><br/>Methods:  The Health Belief Model and Ottawa Model of Research Use helped guide this project.  The project took place at a private primary care practice.  The focus was on patients between the ages of 50 and 75 years old meeting criteria for CRC.  Five PCPS and five medical assistants (MAs) chose to participate in the study.  Participants were given pre and post Practice Culture Assessment (PCA) surveys to measure perceptions of the practice culture.  The project included a three-part practice change: PCP and MA education about CRC screening guidelines, EHR documentation and reminders, and a change of patient visit workflow which included having MAs review patient's CRC screening status before they were seen by the PCP and handing out CRC screening brochures when appropriate.  PCPs then ordered the appropriate CRC screening, and the MA documented the screening in the EHR under a designated location.  CRC Screening Project Evaluation Forms were completed by MAs after each patient visit.<br/><br/>Outcomes:  No significant difference from pre to post survey satisfaction scores were found (t (8) = - 1.542, p= = .162).  Means of quantitative data were reported from the CRC screening evaluation forms; N=91.  The most common method of screening chosen was colonoscopy, 87%.  A strong correlation was found (r (-.293) = .01, p<.05) between receiving a CRC brochure and choosing a form of screening.  Meaningful Use scores pre and post project are pending.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  Patients are more likely to choose a screening method when the topic is raised in a primary care setting.  Continued staff education on workflow is important to sustain this change.

66,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Increasing Perimenopausal Patient and Clinician Satisfaction with Care Through use of Shared Decision Making,43848,Menopause||Decision Making||Nervous System,,2017-05-03,"Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause vary greatly, as do the multitude of available treatment options. It can be difficult for clinicians to manage these symptoms while balancing patient safety concerns and preferences. Shared decision-making (SDM) can assist both the provider and patient to navigate the various treatment options, minimizing gaps between their preferences. To assess the effect of SDM in a nurse-led practice in the Southwest, two nurse practitioners (NP) were invited to use a menopausal decision aid (DA). Women aged 40 to 64 years experiencing VMS were invited to participate in the project. Following a visit with the NP in which the DA was used, patients completed a six question post-intervention survey based on both the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and SDM-Q-9 surveys. Patients were also asked to complete a telephone interview about the process 1-2 weeks post-intervention. The NP completed a post-intervention survey based on the SDM-Q-Doc to assess clinician satisfaction with the SDM process.

With the impact of the shortage causing concern for nurse leaders, retaining Registered Nurses (RNs) is an effective strategy.  The emergency department (ED) work environment provides an additional challenge to keep nurses as the ED is a fast-paced, critical care setting where RNs are providing care to multiple patients with a wide range of needs every shift. This paper will examine current literature addressing factors impacting and strategies for improving ED RN retention.  A systematic review of the literature showed relationship-focused/transformational leadership practices have a positive influence on job satisfaction and organizational commitment which translates to higher RN retention. The literature also indicated complexity leadership is needed in today’s changing health care environment.  An evidence-based practice project was designed to assist the ED leaders evaluate and improve their leadership behaviors. A combination of education and coaching was provided, utilizing the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire to assess the participants’ self- and rater evaluations before and after the intervention.  Although the results were not statically significant, feedback from participants and observations by the coach identified the education and coaching did have an impact on individuals that actively participated in the project.

Studies examining effects of IP with patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have shown improvement in A1C, blood pressure, lipids, self-efficacy and overall greater knowledge of disease process and management. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the impact of IP with attention to identifying and addressing social needs of patients with T2DM.  Participants at least 18 years of age with an A1C >6.5% were identified; Spanish speaking patients were included in this project. The intervention included administration of Health Leads questionnaire to assess social needs. Monthly in person or phone meetings were conducted during a 3-month period.

69,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Interprofessional Collaborative Education in Mental Health: Exploring Attitudes and Beliefs About Collaboration and Teamwork,38106,Education||Behavioral Health||Interprofessional Collaboration||Interprofessional Education,,2016-05-04,"Purpose: Assess provider perceptions on care coordination, collaboration, teamwork, and shared decision-making practices pre and post a brief educational intervention on interprofessional collaboration (IPC).  <br/>Background and significance: A lack of care coordination and active follow up in the outpatient setting of individuals living with mental illness places this population at high risk for developing various comorbidities. Care coordination across care providers and patients in a IPC, patient-centered treatment model of care is an intervention that can reduce this barrier to care.  <br/>Methods: At a behavioral health clinic in the southwestern United States (U.S.) twenty-two participants were assessed via the Collaborative Practice Assessment Tool (CPAT), before and after an educational presentation on IPC care.  The CPAT is a tool that was developed to assess collaborative practice within teams and help identify needs for professional development.  <br/>Results: Statistical significance was found from pretest to posttest scores (t(21) = -1.936, p = .066). Statistical significance was found in two of the eight domains; mission, meaningful purpose, and goals (p = .009) and decision-making and conflict management (p = .058).  Increases in posttest scores were seen in all eight domains.<br/>Conclusions: Training behavioral health professionals in IPC practice and teambuilding may facilitate improved clinical team experiences and communication. Behavioral health professionals treating individuals living with serious mental illness (SMI), IPC training could prepare providers to work more effectively and efficiently in the delivery of patient-centered care in this population with complex health care needs.",,eng,,,Text,51,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,2018-05-01,2016-05-06 20:01:45.738984+00:00,2019-09-05 20:00:04.299022+00:00,0,,,38106.0,,"Violetta, Tina","Harrell, Liz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

71,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Mentorship Matters: Understanding the Impact of Mentorship for Advanced Practice Providers,54070,Mentorship||Nurse Practitioner||Physician Assistant||Advanced Practice Nursing||Personnel Turnover||Organizational Culture,,2019-04-30,"Nurse practitioners and physician assistants, collectively termed advanced practice providers (APPs), report a lack of onboarding and professional support which has been shown to lead to job dissatisfaction, high turnover rates, professional attrition, and gaps in patient care; wasting billions of healthcare dollars and falling short of the Quadruple Aim. A time-honored, integral means of support in many industries is mentorship. This is a dynamic, evolving relationship between an experienced professional and a novice professional that promotes knowledge application, systems navigation, organizational socialization and personal role integration. Unfortunately, healthcare organizations have been slow to adopt mentorship, as evidenced by the paucity of studies on mentorship programs in health care, and APP turnover rates twice that of physicians. This evidenced-based project expands on the limited existing studies regarding the associations between mentorship and organizational commitment, as well as explores the desired characteristics of quality mentors and perceived barriers to APP mentorship.

ADHD can affect academic performance, social interactions, relationships, and self-esteem.  Pharmacological interventions with the use of stimulant medication is the first line of treatment. Children who do not respond to medication trials and suffer adverse side effects need alternative treatment options to manage symptoms. New and immerging treatment options being studied to determine efficacy for symptom management is cognitive behavior therapy, social skills training, exercise and neuro feedback.

77,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Open-Access Scheduling,48650,Emergency Rooms||Patient Satisfaction||Appointments and Schedules,,2018-05-02,"Declaration of Conflicts: This project has no conflicts of interest to declare.<br/><br/>Context:  This project was completed at a federally qualified primary healthcare clinic in Phoenix, Arizona that served patients of all age groups, but primarily cared for the Hispanic population providing primary care, preventative services, family planning, two lab technicians, one promoter, two medical assistant supervisors, five front desk staff, one chief administrative officer, one chief financial officer, two medical directoers who were also providers at the clinic.<br/><br/>Problem and Analysis Assessment: During my clinical rotations, I saw the burden a missed patient appointment had not only on the patients themselves, but also on the clinic, providers, and the staff.  It caused delay in treatment for patients, and it did not allow other patients that wanted to be seen to be seen.  It also increased unnecessary costs and wasted provider time.  Thereafter, I met with some of the leadership team and one of the medical directors to determine a solution to reduce the number of missed appointments that were occurring.  An educational session was kept to discuss the findings of this problem to the providers and the staff and when surveys were handed out to the patients, providers, and staff to assess their satisfaction with the old scheduling system versus the new scheduling system, they were also provided with a cover letter discussing the project.<br/><br/>Intervention: In order for improvements in care to occur, a system process change including the way patients are scheduled must occur.  In this case, an open-access scheduling system (OAS) was implemented.  OAS allows a patient to schedule an appointment on the 'same-day' or the 'next-day' to be seen.  One provider at each of the clinics, each day of the week was available for 'same-day' appointments from 1300-1600.  The providers were still available for scheduled appointments using the previous scheduling method.  Walk-ins were still accepted, and were scheduled based on patient provider preference; however, if an appointment was not available for their preferred provider, they were typically seen with the provider that was the 'same-day' provider for that day.<br/><br/>Strategy for change:  Since patients were only allowed to schedule appointments one month in advance, only one month was needed to implement this process change.  A recommendation for the future would be to clearly identify the patient encounter type, and label it as a same-day appointment, as this would be helpful when gathering and extracting data for this type of patient group specifically.<br/><br/>Measurement of Improvement:  Over a three-month period, a data collection plan was used to determine the number of Mas over a three-month period before and after implementation of this change.  Satisfaction scores were measured using likert scales for patients, provider, and staff, and a dichotomous scale was used to determine the likelihood of emergency room or urgent care use.  A comparison was done to measure revenue during the same time frame.  During the three months, a clinically significant decrease in MAs was seen (<0.52%), with an increase in revenue by 41%.  Additionally, a statistically significant increase in patient, provider and staff satisfaction was also noted when compared to the old scheduling system, as >68% of all patients, providers and staff reported feeling either very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the new scheduling system.  Additionally, patients also reported that they were less likely to visit an emergency room(88%) or urgent care (90%) since they were able to be seen the same-day or the next-day by a provider.<br/><br/>Effects of changes: An incidental finding occurred during this study - where 877 more patients were seen in the three months during the implementation of this project, compared to the three months prior; which likely resulted in a 41% increase in revenue.  Additionally this project, allowed patients that wanted to be seen on the same day, to be seen, and it decreased unnecessary costs associated with emergency room or urgent care visits.  Some of the limitations involved included the current political environment, appointment slots that were previously 15 minutes in length (in 2016), increased to 20 minutes in length (in 2017), a language barrier was noted for the patient surveys since English was not the first language for many of the patients who completed the survey (although documents were translated), and the surveys used were not reliable instrument given that a reliable instrument in previous studies could not be found.<br/><br/>Lessons learnt:  In order to have accuracy of the survey results, it is best for the author of the study to hand out and provide scripture for the survey so that complete data is received from the surveyors.<br/><br/>Messages for others: Begin by making a small process change where only one provider allows for the open-access scheduling so that the entire office is not affected by it, and if results begin to look promising then it can be expanded.  Additionally, correct labeling of patients as 'same-day' is also important so that additional data can be gathered when needed regarding the 'same-day' patients.<br/><br/>Patient/Family/Guardian Involvement:  Patients who benefited from the new scheduling system (open-access scheduling) were asked to fill out a survey that asked them to disclose some demographic data and asked them to determine their satisfaction with the new vs old scheduling system and their likelihood of visiting an emergency room or urgent care.<br/><br/>Ethics Approval: Arizona State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) Received: September 2017",,eng,,,Text,62 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0,Public,,2018-05-09 17:22:37.523700+00:00,2018-06-21 18:49:02.163003+00:00,1,kpardon1,,48650.0,,"Patel, Dimple","Thrall, Charlotte","Uriri-Glover, Johannah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

These injuries worsen when athletes over train, make physical contact, and do not take enough time for rest between injuries. Protocols and therapies need to be implemented to prevent subsequent injuries, including progressive measurement of rehabilitation and return to play (RTP) outcomes. The goal of treatment for these athletes is to return them to their previous level of performance and prevent re-injury. <br/><br/>The purpose of this quality improvement evidence-based project was to determine if the use of the Pediatric Adolescent Shoulder Survey (PASS) affects return to play. The aims of this project were to determine if there was a change in return to play (RTP) outcomes, compare length of RTP between operative and non-operative groups, and determine if PASS scores improved over time.<br/><br/>Methods<br/>The PASS is a 13 item, patient reported outcomes (PROs) survey assessing symptoms, limitations, compensatory mechanisms, and emotional distress. It is reliable and valid for athletes who have acute shoulder injuries and decreased range of motion or strength. <br/><br/>After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the institution and university, providers at a southwestern sports medicine clinic were educated on administration and scoring of the survey.

No statistically significant difference between control group M =118.68 (SD=55.95) days and intervention group M=107.52 (48.77) days was noted. PASS scores showed improvement over time. \\n\\nConclusion\\nThe PASS instrument may positively affect RTP. There was a significant change in RTP for the whole group. Non-operative patients RTP sooner than operative for the whole sample. PASS scores improved over time for all patients.'}], 'extent': ['22 pages'], 'type': ['Text'], 'language': ['eng'], 'title': ['Pediatric Shoulder Rehabilitation'], 'created': '2018-04-30', 'contributor': [{'last': 'Kunz', 'rest': 'Brittany', 'roles': ['Author']}, {'last': \""O'Haver\"", 'rest': 'Judith', 'roles': ['Mentor']}, {'last': 'Uri-Glover', 'rest': 'Johanna', 'roles': ['Mentor']}]}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2018-05-02T18:09:42.216Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

Specific objectives included: 1) Gather and analyze participant demographic information and program utilization by participants for a non-profit cancer support agency, 2) Assess the extent to which those using the support programs experience perceived social support (PSS) and quality of life (QOL), and 3) Assess the utility of the survey process and selected instruments to guide program planning.<br/>Background: Obtaining the diagnosis of cancer is traumatic, but support groups assist in emotional healing among group members. There is strong evidence correlating support group participation with PSS and QOL. The Wilson and Cleary model of QOL clearly links social support and QOL and provided the conceptual framework for this project. <br/>Methods: A survey for self-reported participant demographics, support activities, QOL scores, and PSS scores was implemented. Both online and pencil and paper surveys were available. Instruments included the Flanagan Quality of Life Scale (Cronbach’s α = .82 to .92) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) and a demographic survey created for this project. <br/>Outcomes: All but one survey was completed online (n=48).

The project addresses the transition challenges adults with ASD have in finding a primary care provider who is comfortable and competent with ASD.  Education was provided  to adult primary care providers in a multi-site primary care clinic in a large metropolitan city in the Southwestern United States.  The Modified Knowledge/Attitudes/Belief instrument was used.  A pre-test was administered prior to the education session, then a post-test and a one-month post-test were given afterward.  The results of the education program showed that attitudes and beliefs increased after the education and continued to increase more in the month following.  Knowledge improved after the education session but declined after a month although scores were not back to the pre-education level.  Primary care providers who receive education about ASD may be more comfortable in caring for this population and more likely to welcome adults with ASD into their practice.

Children must remain immobilized for the planning and treatment to ensure the radiation beam precisely delivers radiation to the tumor and reduces exposure to the normal surrounding tissue. Radiation therapy may last several weeks, which requires children to be put under daily anesthesia for an extended length of time to ensure immobilization. The risks for anesthesia include airway obstruction, broncho/laryngospasm, oxygen desaturation, apnea, nausea/vomiting, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, cardiac arrest, sepsis due to central line access, and death.  The relationship between daily anesthesia administration and neurotoxicity is currently unclear.  The purpose of audiovisual distraction (AVD) during radiation therapy was to decrease anesthesia exposure, improve quality of life, and decrease anxiety of patients and families. A plan to implement an AVD device at the time of radiation planning and during daily treatments was conducted in a large pediatric radiation oncology practice in Arizona. Inclusion criteria were children needing radiation, between the ages of 5 and 15, who do not have history or complaint of visual impairment, who have the ability to follow directions for AVD, and were deemed candidates by the Radiation Oncologist and Child Life Specialist through physical and mental assessment. Data collection included anesthesia requirements, heart rate, PedsQL Tool, and time in treatment room gathered at the planning session and at the end of treatment. Microsoft SPSS was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and outcome variables. The aggregated data was analyzed to ascertain if the number of children in the inclusion age range had a decreased need for anesthesia, decreased anxiety, and increased quality of life. The primary outcome for the AVD was: all four children who participated were able to undergo radiation therapy without the need for anesthesia . The children were able to remain awake for treatment could attend school, as permissible, eat before treatment, and spend significantly less time at the treatment facility. The concern of repetitive anesthesia and neurotoxicity will not be a factor in the child’s long term late effects of treatment. The reduction of need on anesthesia staff and nursing staff was estimated to save over 500,000 dollars for the 89 treatments the four children underwent with the AVD. The benefits of the intervention not only provided a better treatment experience for all children, but it  allowed the facility to utilize the treatment machine more efficiently, providing radiation therapy as an option to even more patients.",,eng,,,Text,28 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,Public,,2019-06-03 21:13:47.213964+00:00,2019-06-03 21:13:47.762322+00:00,1,kpardon1,,54069.0,,"Mabry, Amy S.","Chiffelle, Rochelle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Provider recruitment strategies offering loan repayment have had some success in the short term, but are less impactful at creating a long-term retention rate, unless the providers have an existing connection to either the community in which they are working or rural healthcare (Renner et al., 2010). Responding to this data, a demonstration project has been created in Colorado to test a rural focused “grow your own” advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) model. This model is designed to recruit RNs from inside rural communities to return to school and become primary care providers within those communities upon graduation. The project offers stipend support with assistance in the school application process, educational support, clinical and job placement assistance, and monthly coaching. Additionally, communities are asked to provide matching funds to support the APRN students with a goal of creating a self-sustaining model that will build a continuous pipeline of APRN providers. This strategy avoids the costly need to recruit and relocate providers who have no ties to the community. The initial response from rural nurses and communities around the state has been overwhelmingly successful. This success suggests that this model could serve as a new and sustainable strategy for building a rural APRN provider workforce pipeline while ensuring access to a primary care health provider for all people living in rural areas.",,eng,,,Text,51 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2017-05-05 23:18:06.490307+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:24.081640+00:00,1,kpardon1,,43603.0,,"Johnson, Ingrid M.","Porter-O'Grady, Timothy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

From 2007-2010, 58.2% of women and 41.8% of men reported taking five or more prescription drugs within the last 30 days (CDC, 2014). Negative outcomes include prescription drug abuse, side effects, interactions, treatment failure, patient dissatisfaction, and lack of treatment control. The associated practice challenges have led to the following PICOT question. In persons with mental health issues receiving care at an outpatient mental health clinic, does engaging in mindfulness practice versus no mindfulness practice change polypharmacy use over a 3-month period? The project purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of Insight Timer mobile mindfulness app at helping patients self-manage distressing symptoms and reduce polypharmacy. Over three weeks, mental health clinic nurse practitioners (NPs) voluntarily recruited patients (n=12) over age 18 using as needed prescriptions (PRNs), and agreed to use Insight Timer mobile mindfulness app for adjunct symptom management. Consenting participants downloaded the mobile app, and completed a brief questionnaire measuring PRN use at the start of app use, and PRN use at their next visit. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a 10-week mindfulness app trial did not significantly lower total PRN doses compared with pre-app dosing (Z = -.534, p = .593). Paired t-tests revealed no significant change in pre (M = 65.17, SD = 28.64) versus post (M = 67.75, SD = 20.22) OQ45 life functionality results (t(11)  = -.420, p = .683) (d = .121) as a result of app use. Clinically relevant results illustrated 83.33% of participants taking greater than nine PRN doses over the study period used the app six times or more in place of medication. High PRN users employed the app frequently in place of medication regardless of total PRN doses taken. Practice implications and sustainability recommendations include incorporating mobile app use in treatment plans for high PRN users and educating NP’s on the tangible benefits of mindfulness apps in reducing polypharmacy and easing symptom distress on an ongoing basis.   <br/>Keywords: mindfulness, mhealth, mobile apps, mobile smart phone, online, RCT, behavior change, polypharmacy.",,eng,,,Text,51 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NKC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,2020-05-01,2019-04-30 1:57:42.108163+00:00,2019-05-02 23:26:57.938264+00:00,1,guthery,,53154.0,,"Pierce, Albert","Guthery, Ann",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

95,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,"Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT): Implementation in the Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatric Setting",53276,Adolescent||Behavioral Health||SBIRT||Screening||Referral to Treatment,,2019-05-02,"BACKGROUND: The cost of substance use (SU) in the United States (U.S.) is estimated at $1.25 trillion annually. SU is a worldwide health concern, impacting physical and psychological health of those who use substances, their friends, family members, communities and nations. Screening, Brief Intervention (BI) and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) provides an evidence-based (EB) framework to detect and treat SU. Evidence shows that mental health (MH) providers are not providing EB SU management. Federally grant-funded SBIRT demonstrated evidence of decreased SU and prevention of full disorders. Implementation outcomes in smaller-scale projects have included increased clinician knowledge, documentation and interdisciplinary teamwork. <br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: To improve quality of care (QOC) for adolescents who use substances in the inpatient psychiatric setting by implementing EB SBIRT practices.<br/><br/>METHODS: Research questions focused on whether the number of SBIRT notes documented (N=170 charts) increased and whether training of the interdisciplinary team (N=26 clinicians) increased SBIRT knowledge. Individualized interventions used existing processes, training and a new SBIRT Note template. An SBIRT knowledge survey was adapted from a similar study. A pre-and post-chart audit was conducted to show increase in SBIRT documentation. The rationale for the latter was not only for compliance, but also so that all team members can know the status of SBIRT services. Thus, increased interdisciplinary teamwork was an intentional, though indirect, outcome. <br/><br/>RESULTS:  A paired-samples t-test indicated clinician SBIRT knowledge significantly increased, with a large effect size. The results suggest that a short, 45-60-minute tailored education module can significantly increase clinician SBIRT knowledge.  Auditing screening & BI notes both before and after the study period yielded important patient SU information and which types of SBIRT documentation increased post-implementation. The CRAFFT scores of the patients were quite high from a SU perspective, averaging over 3/6 both pre- and post-implementation, revealing over an 80% chance that the adolescent patient had a SU disorder. Most patients were positive for at least one substance (pre- = 47.1%; post- = 65.2%), with cannabis and alcohol being the most commonly used substances. Completed CRAFFT screenings increased from 62.5% to 72.7% of audited patients. Post-implementation, there were two types of BI notes: the preexisting Progress Note BI (PN BI) and the new Auto-Text BI (AT BI), part of the new SBIRT Note template introduced during implementation. The PN BIs not completed despite a positive screen increased from 79.6% to 83.7%. PN BIs increased 1%. The option for AT BI notes ameliorated this effect. Total BI notes completed for a patient positive for a substance increased from 20.4% to 32.6%, with 67.4% not receiving a documented BI. Total BIs completed for all patients was 21.2% post-implementation.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: This project is scalable throughout the U.S. in MH settings and will provide crucial knowledge about positive and negative drivers in small-scale SBIRT implementations. The role of registered nurses (RNs), social workers and psychiatrists in providing SBIRT services as an interdisciplinary team will be enhanced. Likely conclusions are that short trainings can significantly increase clinician knowledge about SBIRT and compliance with standards. Consistent with prior evidence, significant management involvement, SBIRT champions, thought leaders and other consistent emphasis is necessary to continue improving SBIRT practice in the target setting.<br/><br/>Keywords: adolescents, teenagers, youth, alcohol, behavioral health, cannabis, crisis, documentation, drug use, epidemic, high-risk use, illicit drugs, implementation, mental health, opiates, opioid, pilot study, psychiatric inpatient hospital, quality improvement, SBIRT, Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, substance use, unhealthy alcohol use, use disorders",,eng,,,Text,84 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,2021-05-01,2019-05-03 2:08:02.632474+00:00,2019-05-06 17:50:00.193198+00:00,1,guthery,,53276.0,,"Maixner, Roberta","Guthery, Ann","Mensik, Jennifer","Uriri-Glover, Johannah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

SU is a worldwide health concern, impacting physical and psychological health of those who use substances, their friends, family members, communities and nations. Screening, Brief Intervention (BI) and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) provides an evidence-based (EB) framework to detect and treat SU. Evidence shows that mental health (MH) providers are not providing EB SU management. Federally grant-funded SBIRT demonstrated evidence of decreased SU and prevention of full disorders. Implementation outcomes in smaller-scale projects have included increased clinician knowledge, documentation and interdisciplinary teamwork. \\nOBJECTIVE: To improve quality of care (QOC) for adolescents who use substances in the inpatient psychiatric setting by implementing EB SBIRT practices.\\nMETHODS: Research questions focused on whether the number of SBIRT notes documented (N=170 charts) increased and whether training of the interdisciplinary team (N=26 clinicians) increased SBIRT knowledge. Individualized interventions used existing processes, training and a new SBIRT Note template. An SBIRT knowledge survey was adapted from a similar study. A pre-and post-chart audit was conducted to show increase in SBIRT documentation. The rationale for the latter was not only for compliance, but also so that all team members can know the status of SBIRT services. Thus, increased interdisciplinary teamwork was an intentional, though indirect, outcome. \\nRESULTS:  A paired-samples t-test indicated clinician SBIRT knowledge significantly increased, with a large effect size. The results suggest that a short, 45-60-minute tailored education module can significantly increase clinician SBIRT knowledge. \\nAuditing screening & BI notes both before and after the study period yielded important patient SU information and which types of SBIRT documentation increased post-implementation. The CRAFFT scores of the patients were quite high from a SU perspective, averaging over 3/6 both pre- and post-implementation, revealing over an 80% chance that the adolescent patient had a SU disorder. Most patients were positive for at least one substance (pre- = 47.1%; post- = 65.2%), with cannabis and alcohol being the most commonly used substances. Completed CRAFFT screenings increased from 62.5% to 72.7% of audited patients.\\nPost-implementation, there were two types of BI notes: the preexisting Progress Note BI (PN BI) and the new Auto-Text BI (AT BI), part of the new SBIRT Note template introduced during implementation. The PN BIs not completed despite a positive screen increased from 79.6% to 83.7%. PN BIs increased 1%. The option for AT BI notes ameliorated this effect. Total BI notes completed for a patient positive for a substance increased from 20.4% to 32.6%, with 67.4% not receiving a documented BI. Total BIs completed for all patients was 21.2% post-implementation.\\nCONCLUSION: This project is scalable throughout the U.S. in MH settings and will provide crucial knowledge about positive and negative drivers in small-scale SBIRT implementations. The role of registered nurses (RNs), social workers and psychiatrists in providing SBIRT services as an interdisciplinary team will be enhanced. Likely conclusions are that short trainings can significantly increase clinician knowledge about SBIRT and compliance with standards. Consistent with prior evidence, significant management involvement, SBIRT champions, thought leaders and other consistent emphasis is necessary to continue improving SBIRT practice in the target setting.\\nKeywords: adolescents, teenagers, youth, alcohol, behavioral health, cannabis, crisis, documentation, drug use, epidemic, high-risk use, illicit drugs, implementation, mental health, opiates, opioid, pilot study, psychiatric inpatient hospital, quality improvement, SBIRT, Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, substance use, unhealthy alcohol use, use disorders'}], 'title': ['Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT): Implementation in the Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatric Setting'], 'reuse': 'All Rights Reserved', 'subject': ['Adolescent, SBIRT Behaviroal Health'], 'created': '2019-05-02', 'contributor': [{'last': 'Guthery', 'rest': 'Ann', 'roles': ['Teacher']}, {'last': 'Maixner', 'rest': 'Roberta', 'roles': ['Author']}, {'last': 'Mensik', 'rest': 'Jennifer', 'roles': ['Teacher']}, {'last': 'Uriri-Glover', 'rest': 'Johannah', 'roles': ['Teacher']}]}"", ""embargo_date"": ""2021-05-01"", ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2019-05-03T02:08:02.635Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 12855}}]"

Arthritis is the leading cause of disability among American adults, with over 50 million individuals affected. The Latino population experiences a disproportionate incidence of disability attributable to arthritis compared to other populations. Evidence supports self-management education incorporating physical activity as a promising intervention for arthritis. <br/>Methods<br/>The intervention included a curriculum developed by the Arthritis Association, three teaching sessions, and a pre/post-test. Anticipated outcomes included decreased pain measured by the Pain Visual Numeric, decreased report of disability measured by the Stanford HAQ, and increased self-efficacy measured by the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale.  The setting was a faith-based medical clinic that services the uninsured population located within Southwest Arizona. Participants included Spanish and English speaking adults diagnosed with arthritis.<br/>Results<br/>Twelve participants were consented however, only eight participants completed the entire project. Although the mean pain score decreased, indicating reduced pain, it was not statistically significant (pretest- M=5.75 SD=3.19; posttest- M=5.25 SD=2.82; z (7)=-.11, p= .92). However, there was a statistically significant increase in reports of exercise after the intervention (pretest M=.83, SD=.39; posttest- M=.43, SD=.53; z (6)=-2.0, p =.046). This was in response to an non validated question developed by the primary investigator and co-investigator of, “Do you currently exercise?”.<br/>Conclusions 	<br/>Results include increases in reports of exercise post-intervention and decreased pain. The use of non-pharmacological interventions such as self-management to reduce pain and increase mobility in arthritic patients can help lessen the socioeconomic health disparity gaps.",,eng,,,Text,100 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2016-05-06 22:41:34.965658+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:23.974183+00:00,1,,,38111.0,,"Kerth, Sonja","Velasquez, Donna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Evidence suggests the importance of implementing a severity stratification tool to improve early identification of SSTI’s. The aim of this evidence based project is to examine if educating healthcare staff on the use of a severity stratification tool would increase staff knowledge of SSTI's. The sample consisted of 18 participants, 12 healthcare providers and 6 healthcare staff at a correctional facility in the Southwestern United States. A pre-and posttest design, including an educational session was implemented. A 14-item multiple choice self-developed questionnaire was used to evaluate participants’ knowledge of identifying and ranking SSTI’s using the CREST tool. A one tail paired t-test was performed to compare the pre-and post-test case study scores for the healthcare provider group. A significant increase from pre-test to post-test case study scores was found (t(13)= -6.19, p < 0.00). Of the healthcare providers, 57% found the tool “moderately helpful.” Of the non-provider sample, 50% found the tool “extremely helpful” and plan to use the tool “all of the time.” The findings of this study suggest that implementing an educational session on a wound severity stratification tool improves staff knowledge and increases the likelihood of the tool being used in practice.

Cardiovascular Rehabilitation (CR) is a medically supervised program designed to helpimprove cardiovascular health for patients who have experienced heart attack, heart failure,angioplasty, or heart surgery (AHA, 2016). A hospital in the southwestern region of the UnitedStates of America reports their 2016 CR attendance rate of 79 %, which is much lower than the national average of 94% (AACVPR, 2016). Motivational interviewing (MI) is a proven method used to promote a positive behavior change for cardiac rehab patients. MI includes quality improvement activities such as peer support and cardiac rehab educational classes that have shown to increase health related quality of life measures and decreased depression symptoms (Pietrabessa et al., 2017; Pack et al., 2013). Despite all the knowledge about CR and its benefits for health nationally, there are low attendance rates, therefore the purpose of this evidence-based project is to improve CR attendance rates using MI. Patients enrolled into CR participated in the motivational interviewing for eight classes. At the end of the class, they were given notecards to create Specific Measureable Achievable Realistic and Timely (SMART) Goals for themselves for that week. The measurement tools, the PHQ-9 and Dartmouth COOP is a simple, reliable, and valid tool for assessing functional status of cardiac patients and the current CR program utilizes this tool and is familiar with explaining this tool (Eaton, Young, Fergussion, Garrett, & Kolbe, 2005). A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the relationship between the MI classes and the CR attendance, depression scores, and quality of life. A strong positive correlation was found (r (82)= .456, p< .001) indicating a significant linear relationship between motivational interviewing and cardiac rehab attendance. A weak correlation that was not significant for depression symptoms and quality of life. The impact of this evidence-based project is to give cardiac rehab programs further evidence that the implementation of motivational interviewing can positively influence cardiac rehab attendance rates.",,eng,,,Text,47 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2019-10-14 18:43:54.927166+00:00,2019-10-14 18:43:56.061283+00:00,2,kpardon1,,54609.0,,"Kungu, Wairumu","Nunez, Diane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

A hospital in the southwestern region of the UnitedStates of America reports their 2016 CR attendance rate of 79 %, which is much lower than the national average of 94% (AACVPR, 2016). Motivational interviewing (MI) is a proven method used to promote a positive behavior change for cardiac rehab patients. MI includes quality improvement activities such as peer support and cardiac rehab educational classes that have shown to increase health related quality of life measures and decreased depression symptoms (Pietrabessa et al., 2017; Pack et al., 2013).

104,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Supporting Advanced Practice Provider Transition to Practice: A Theoretical and Evidence-Based Intervention,43565,Transition to Practice||Nurse Practicioner||Inservice Training||Physician Assistant,,2017-04-29,"New graduate nurse practitioners and physician assistants, also known as advanced practice providers (APPs), face a significant number of challenges when entering professional practice. If the new graduate does not receive sufficient guidance and support during this transition to practice (TTP), they will likely experience significant psychological stress and anxiety. If an organization does not implement measures to address TTP, the new graduate is much more likely to leave the current position within the first two years of practice. An extensive literature review was conducted investigating the effects, and necessary components of an orientation program which supports the new graduate through TTP.

109,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Team-Based Care in the Management of Type 2 Diabetes with Consideration for Social Determinants of Health,44618,Diabetes Mellitus||Social Determinants of Health||Patient Care Team,,2017-05-02,"The reactionary nature of the current healthcare delivery system in the United States has led to increased healthcare spending from acute exacerbations of chronic disease and unnecessary hospitalizations. Those who suffer from chronic diseases are particularly at risk. The dynamics of health care must include grappling with the complexities of where and how people live and attempt to manage their health and disease. Team-based care may offer a solution due to its interdisciplinary focus on proactive, preventative care delivered in outpatient primary care. Studies examining the effects of team-based care have shown improvement in; HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, healthcare team morale, patient satisfaction rates, quality of care, and patient empowerment. In an effort to improve type 2 diabetes health outcomes and patient satisfaction a team based care project was implemented. The setting was an outpatient primary care clinic where the patients are known to have limited social resources. The healthcare team was comprised of a DNP Student, Master of Social Work Student, Clinical Pharmacist, and Primary Care Physician, who discussed patient specifics during informal meetings and referral processes. Adult patients whose HbA1c level was greater than 6.5% were eligible to participate, 183 were identified and invited. Fourteen (14) agreed to participate and seven (7) completed the initial screening with a mean HbA1c of 9.7%. Significant social needs were identified using the Health Leads Questionnaire. The diabetes and social needs were addressed by members of the team<br/>who met individually with patients monthly over the course of three months.

The effects of depression and anxiety not only affect the individual, but also peers, family, the community, economy, and even the health care system. Pharmacological therapy is a first line treatment for depression and anxiety, but the risk for relapse remains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) are treatments that have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. The evidence suggests that both therapies are successful in terms of reducing depressive symptoms, but most effective when combined. Further, evidence shows that the combination of MBCT and traditional pharmacological therapy provides relief from depressive symptoms and lengthens the amount of time between recurrent episodes and improves the quality of life. A project was implemented at an integrated health clinic to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results revealed that practicing mindfulness was statistically and clinically significant in reducing depression and anxiety. In addition, mindfulness scores increased over 30 day application of the intervention. The results demonstrated the value of utilizing mindfulness as a cost-effective therapy in addition to pharmacological treatment to decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improve mindfulness.

The results revealed that practicing mindfulness was statistically and clinically significant in reducing depression and anxiety. In addition, mindfulness scores increased over 30 day application of the intervention. The results demonstrated the value of utilizing mindfulness as a cost-effective therapy in addition to pharmacological treatment to decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improve mindfulness. The ease of use demonstrated the value of mindfulness and self-directed skills aimed at improving wellness, reducing depression and anxiety which will result in the improvement of individual, economic, healthcare system, and community health.'}], 'reuse': 'All Rights Reserved', 'subject': ['Mindfulness', 'Depression', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', 'Resilience', 'Drug Therapy'], 'extent':

The redundancies and nurse dissatisfaction with the electronic health record requires a new approach. The advancement of a shared governance model to a professional governance model has resulted in an increase in professional role involvement in four areas: (1) accountability, (2) professional obligation, (3) collateral relationships, and (4) decision-making. Increased professional nurse involvement results in, nurses more actively engaged in problem solving to improve nurse satisfaction with the electronic health record.

A pre and post quasi-experimental design evaluated the attitude of providers regarding practice change using the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale and the utilization of the MDQ following educational intervention. Parametric testing was used to explore the relationship between education specific to practice change and the provider's attitude through the use of the paired t test.

118,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,The Role of Sponsorship and Relapse Prevention,48287,Relapse||Prevention||Addiction||Residential Treatment,,2018-04-21,"Background and Aims: The aim of this research was to assess whether clients receiving treatment for substance abuse in a residential treatment facility will achieve lower rates of relapse with treatment in combination with active sponsorship. Prior studies suggest sponsorship may equally be impactful as attending 12-step meetings. <br/><br/>Design: The primary hypothesis was that active participation as defined by contact with a sponsor of an hour or more per week, as measured by the impact on affective characteristics correlated with increased levels of sobriety, when measured by the AWARE questionnaire (Advance Warning of Relapse) within 7 days of entry and prior to discharge (within 30 days). Setting: The project took place in a residential treatment facility in Phoenix, Arizona. <br/><br/>Participants: There were 12 clients from a men’s house and 12 clients from a woman’s house, all of which were going through recovery.

Prior studies suggest sponsorship may equally be impactful as attending 12-step meetings. \\n\\nDesign: The primary hypothesis was that active participation as defined by contact with a sponsor of an hour or more per week, as measured by the impact on affective characteristics correlated with increased levels of sobriety, when measured by the AWARE questionnaire (Advance Warning of Relapse) within 7 days of entry and prior to discharge (within 30 days). Setting: The project took place in a residential treatment facility in Phoenix, Arizona. \\n\\nParticipants: There were 12 clients from a men\u2019s house and 12 clients from a woman\u2019s house, all of which were going through recovery.

This project was done to evaluate and offer evidence-based suggestions for improvement to a multidisciplinary care coordination team in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO). Internal data suggests the team is underutilized within the ACO and that the ACO is underperforming. Conscious workflow design has been shown to improve the efficiency of existing work processes.<br/><br/>Methods: The care coordination team (N=6), licensed practical nurses and social workers, were the project participants. Following Institutional Review Board approval, a presentation was given on current ACO performance data and project goals. Team members were invited to participate by filling out a survey. The 31-item Team Development Measure (Cronbach’s α) assessed team functioning to identify where gaps exist in the team’s processes. Further knowledge about workflow was gained via quality improvement methods of direct observation and informal conversational interviews with team members, the ACO team manager, and various providers within the ACO and their staff. Field notes were analyzed and confirmed with the ACO team manager. Rasch analysis was performed on survey data to convert ordinal numeric results from the Likert scale into an interval score from 0 to 100, which correlates with elements of team development.<br/><br/>Results: Rasch analysis revealed a mean score of 54.17 (SD=8.06). Based on this score, the team has cohesiveness and communication in place but has not yet established role and goal clarity. Analysis of notes and impressions revealed a lack of adherence to date deadlines, inconsistent processes among team members, and use of non-evidence based patient care interventions such as minimal to no home visits and a lack of standardized patient education. Team analysis results, workflow observations, and current evidence on transitional care were integrated into an executive report containing realistic prioritized changes that maximize team member’s skill sets and clarify roles and goals of the team which was provided to the ACO administration along with recommendations for evidence-based process improvements.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This project can serve as a model for analyzing team functioning and workflow to inform agencies where gaps in their processes are affecting performance. The analysis can then be used to recommend evidence based practice changes.

The 31-item Team Development Measure (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1\\uf03d\\uf02e\\uf039\\uf037) assessed team functioning to identify where gaps exist in the team\u2019s processes. Further knowledge about workflow was gained via quality improvement methods of direct observation and informal conversational interviews with team members, the ACO team manager, and various providers within the ACO and their staff. Field notes were analyzed and confirmed with the ACO team manager. Rasch analysis was performed on survey data to convert ordinal numeric results from the Likert scale into an interval score from 0 to 100, which correlates with elements of team development.\\n\\nResults: Rasch analysis revealed a mean score of 54.17 (SD=8.06). Based on this score, the team has cohesiveness and communication in place but has not yet established role and goal clarity. Analysis of notes and impressions revealed a lack of adherence to date deadlines, inconsistent processes among team members, and use of non-evidence based patient care interventions such as minimal to no home visits and a lack of standardized patient education. Team analysis results, workflow observations, and current evidence on transitional care were integrated into an executive report containing realistic prioritized changes that maximize team member\u2019s skill sets and clarify roles and goals of the team which was provided to the ACO administration along with recommendations for evidence-based process improvements.\\n\\nConclusion: This project can serve as a model for analyzing team functioning and workflow to inform agencies where gaps in their processes are affecting performance. The analysis can then be used to recommend evidence based practice changes.

Influenza vaccinations may reduce these complications yet approximately half of children remain unprotected annually.   Synthesized evidence supports integration of text messaging into a multi-component strategy to increase the influenza vaccination rate in many populations of interest. <br/><br/>Methods:  The intervention was a single text message and electronic mail message sent to all families in a private pediatric pulmonology practice who enabled text and/or electronic mail messages in the patient portal.  A follow-up survey assessed various aspects of message receipt.  Surveys were completed without collection of demographic information.<br/><br/>Results:  Electronic mail messages were sent to 3140 addresses available in the patient portal.  The number of text messages sent out via the patient portal was 75 with 66 (88%) delivered successfully.  Follow-up surveys were initiated by 107 recipients.  Frequency analysis showed that participants preferred text and electronic mail messages over other forms of communication. A statistically significant positive relationship was found utilizing Chi Square between those who received a message and those whose child received an influenza vaccination (p= .027).<br/><br/>Conclusions:  Text and electronic mail messaging are cost-effective and well-received forms of communication that can be easily integrated into existing systems.
