Post-education scores (Mdn = 0.71) were significantly higher compared to pre-education scores (Mdn = 0.56); U = 102.5, z = -4.05, p = .001. Monthly incidence of pressure injuries on the unit increased following education.  \\n\\nDiscussion: Increase in scores from pre- to post-education surveys indicate staff knowledge improved.

Background and Significance: PPD is highly prevalent among women living in the United States and threatens the physical and psychological health of MIDs. Many of these women go undiagnosed and without treatment, further worsening symptoms and outcomes. This has inspired world healthcare leaders and organizations to address maternal mental health among postpartum women. Methods: A 12-week evidenced-based project consisted of two-sets of participants including mothers and staff. A comprehensive maternal support program guided by an informational pamphlet (IP) and implementation of PPD screening using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale served as the two-part intervention for this project. Goals were to decrease PPD, enhance BF satisfaction, and strengthen the MID. Comprehensive maternal support encompasses interventions proven to meet the project goals and includes tailored BF education and care to maternal needs, social support by peer/family involvement, skin-to-skin contact during BF, emotion-regulation strategies, and availability of community resources. Outcomes: The BSES-SF scores did result in statistical significance based on an alpha value of 0.10, t(3) = -2.98, p = .059, proving a positive effect was seen in breastfeeding self-efficacy post intervention. The results did not show statistical significance (t(3) = 0.60, p = .591) in regard to pre and post-depression scores. However, the mean pre-score (M =3.50, SD 3.11) did decrease post-intervention (M =2.75, SD 1.26) and exemplifies clinical significance.

The VA reports less than 9 million veterans enrolled in VA services, leaving over 50% seeking treatment from civilian providers. Given the high prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the military population, it is imperative to implement a valid and reliable screening tool at primary care facilities to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. <br/><br/>Method: This project aimed to provide an evidence-based education for intake nurses to understand prevalence of PTSD and to use a screening tool Primary Care PTSD for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) in a non-VA behavioral health facility. <br/><br/>Setting: The project site was a civilian behavioral health facility located in West Phoenix Metropolitan area.  The behavioral health facility serves mental health and substance abuse needs.  Project implementation focused on the intake department. <br/><br/>Measures: Sociodemographic data, PTSD diagnosis criteria, prevalence and PC-PTDSD-5 screening tool knowledge collected from pre and posttest evaluation.

For PTSD-related knowledge, the pre-test score (Mdn = 6.00) was significantly lower than the post-test score (Mdn = 10.00; Z= -4.23, p < .001), suggesting an increase of PTSD knowledge among nurses after the education.

A federally qualified health center (FQHC) reported that they did not have a standardized comprehensive sexual health history taking process. To address this concern, a literature review was conducted to survey current evidence regarding both patient and healthcare provider perspective on sexual health history taking. While it is recommended for a sexual health history to be performed routinely, both healthcare providers and patients have reported sexual health is not discussed at most visits.

Informal caregivers provide most long-term care for the elderly in this country and save hundreds of billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. However, most informal caregivers experience burden secondary to caregiving that adversely impacts their physical, social, and/or psychological health. Caregiver burden threatens caregiver health and contributes to institutionalization of care recipients.

The assessment included caregiver demographics, interest in caregiver services, and the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) to assess caregiver burden. The ZBI-12 has good reliability and validity as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 and a correlation with the full version ZBI scores of 0.95.

The purpose of audiovisual distraction (AVD) during radiation therapy was to decrease anesthesia exposure, improve quality of life, and decrease anxiety of patients and families. A plan to implement an AVD device at the time of radiation planning and during daily treatments was conducted in a large pediatric radiation oncology practice in Arizona.

This study sought to build and deliver an evidence-based, family-centered equine assisted learning program aimed at promoting family function, family satisfaction and child social-emotional competence, and to measure its acceptability and preliminary effect. <br/><br/>Method: Twenty families with children 10 years and older were recruited to participate in a 3-week equine assisted learning program at a therapeutic riding center in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions included groundwork activities with horses used to promote life skills using experiential learning theory. The study design included a mixed-method quasi-experimental one-group pretest posttest design using the following mental health instruments: Devereaux Student Strengths Assessment, Brief Family Assessment Measure (3 dimensions), and Family Satisfaction Scale to measure child social-emotional competence, family function, and family satisfaction, respectively.

Arizona’s drowning rate is nearly double the national average for this age group. Water safety is an important anticipatory guidance topic a primary care provider should be discussing at all well visits.  The Health Belief Model is an effective framework to guide family education interventions.

The tailored intervention evoked positive interaction and receptivity from parents and suggested a high motivation to make a behavior change. The effect of the intervention could not be tested due to the lack of follow-up and post data collection.  The design of this evidence-based project is quantifiable and replicable in a low-acuity setting, which allows for future evaluations of self-reported behavior change and knowledge improvement.

Poor sleep can affect activities of daily living, job performance and personal relationships. Poor sleep can be difficult to detect because some may consider it a symptom because of their lifestyle. The purpose of this study is to assess participants sleep quality and functional outcomes of poor sleep.<br/><br/>Methods: Primary care providers have an opportunity to screen for sleep disorders as part of the intake process during an office visit. The Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), has been proposed as guide to determine if a sleep disorder is affecting quality of life. This descriptive study randomly recruited 20 participants from a community health center. A 10-question survey was given to individuals over the age of 18 who can write and speak English and either have a body mass index (BMI) over 30, hypertension (HTN) or diabetes type II (DMII). Demographic information evaluated included age, gender, HTN, DMII, BMI>30, marital status, sleeping alone, employment type, race, type of insurance, how many times do they wake up at night, the average number of hours slept per night and does the person work night shift.<br/><br/>Results: The study used a qualitative approach with a descriptive methodology; statistical analysis consisted of proportions, means and standard deviation to describe the study population. Participant age ranged from 33 to 72 years (M=50.1, SD= 11.32). Sixty percent were both female and married/living with partner. Despite being married/living with partner, 50% slept alone. A Mann-Whitney U test showed that there was a significant difference in four of the questions in the FOSQ-10 in which functional outcomes were not affected by being sleepy or tired.<br/><br/>Conclusion: The FOSQ-10 may serve a role in identifying patients who might benefit from a sleep study.

Medical patient portals have the potential to provide patients with timely, transparent access to health care information and engage them in their health care process and management. This may result in improved disease management outcomes.<br/><br/>Methods: This project was guided by a The Rosswurm and Larrabee Model for Change to Evidence- Based Practice and Pender’s health promotion framework. IRB Approved by ASU. The instruction was implemented at an urban clinic in downtown phoenix that serves uninsured and underserved individuals. Uninsured participants were recruited (n=50).

SU is a worldwide health concern, impacting physical and psychological health of those who use substances, their friends, family members, communities and nations. Screening, Brief Intervention (BI) and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) provides an evidence-based (EB) framework to detect and treat SU. Evidence shows that mental health (MH) providers are not providing EB SU management. Federally grant-funded SBIRT demonstrated evidence of decreased SU and prevention of full disorders. Implementation outcomes in smaller-scale projects have included increased clinician knowledge, documentation and interdisciplinary teamwork. <br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: To improve quality of care (QOC) for adolescents who use substances in the inpatient psychiatric setting by implementing EB SBIRT practices.<br/><br/>METHODS: Research questions focused on whether the number of SBIRT notes documented (N=170 charts) increased and whether training of the interdisciplinary team (N=26 clinicians) increased SBIRT knowledge. Individualized interventions used existing processes, training and a new SBIRT Note template. An SBIRT knowledge survey was adapted from a similar study. A pre-and post-chart audit was conducted to show increase in SBIRT documentation. The rationale for the latter was not only for compliance, but also so that all team members can know the status of SBIRT services. Thus, increased interdisciplinary teamwork was an intentional, though indirect, outcome. <br/><br/>RESULTS:  A paired-samples t-test indicated clinician SBIRT knowledge significantly increased, with a large effect size. The results suggest that a short, 45-60-minute tailored education module can significantly increase clinician SBIRT knowledge.  Auditing screening & BI notes both before and after the study period yielded important patient SU information and which types of SBIRT documentation increased post-implementation. The CRAFFT scores of the patients were quite high from a SU perspective, averaging over 3/6 both pre- and post-implementation, revealing over an 80% chance that the adolescent patient had a SU disorder. Most patients were positive for at least one substance (pre- = 47.1%; post- = 65.2%), with cannabis and alcohol being the most commonly used substances.

ACEs refer to experiences related to abuse, household challenges, or neglect that occur before the age of 18. Some of the effects of ACEs include anxiety, depression, increased stress, increase in high-risk behaviors, and early death. Mindfulness practices have been shown to be an effective tool in reducing some of these symptoms. In looking for ways to prevent or mitigate the effects of ACEs, it is important to provide tools and resources to the adults taking care of children including; parents, guardians, and teachers. The purpose of this evidence based project (EBP) was to evaluate mindfulness and classroom environments after the implementation of a mindfulness intervention. The intervention consisted of a three day training followed by four weeks of mindfulness practice prior to beginning the school day. Ten preschool and Early Head Start teachers from seven classrooms at a school in inner city Phoenix participated in the project.

The 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention aims to improve the area of clinical prevention. Emergency departments (ED) play a key role in addressing this effort as they have multiple opportunities to connect with patients who are at risk. There exists a high-risk period of time immediately following a patient’s discharge from emergency care. To address this period of concern, a review of the literature was conducted on the effectiveness of follow-up contacts as a means to prevent suicide and suicide related attempts in this at-risk population. Based on this review, a follow-up intervention was proposed to increase patients’ social support and knowledge on suicide prevention through a safety plan and the use of caring postcards. The aim was to evaluate the degree to which implementation of a safety plan and follow-up using postcards reduces suicide risk in the ED. ED suicide prevention practices such as safety planning and caring contacts with postcards have shown to be feasible and cost-effective methods to reduce patients’ risk of suicide as they provide education and address the high-risk period of time after discharge. Using a quasi-experimental pre and post-test design, English speaking adults 18 years of age and older, admitted to an ED in the Phoenix Metropolitan area with suicidal ideation, were voluntarily recruited for two weeks. The self-rated Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used as a baseline assessment along with the introduction of a safety plan. Participants were then followed with the receipt of postcards with caring messages over a two-week period, and a final SBQ-R. The SBQ-R has shown beneficial reliability and validity measuring suicidality in the adult population. Data from the pre-SBQ-R was analyzed using descriptive statistics as no post-SBQ-Rs were received. Outcomes for this project included a reduction in suicidal ideation and suicide risk. This project provides insight into the implementation of a safety plan and follow-up intervention in the ED and their attempts to reduce acute suicide risk as well as highlight the value that post-ED support provides. <br/>Keywords: suicide, prevention, safety plan, caring messages, postcards, emergency department, follow-up, contacts, brief intervention",,eng,,,Text,54 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NKC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,2020-05-01,2019-04-30 1:46:57.388860+00:00,2019-05-02 21:15:25.372378+00:00,1,guthery,,53151.0,,"Boothe, Ryan","Guthery, Ann",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

ED suicide prevention practices such as safety planning and caring contacts with postcards have shown to be feasible and cost-effective methods to reduce patients\u2019 risk of suicide as they provide education and address the high-risk period of time after discharge. Using a quasi-experimental pre and post-test design, English speaking adults 18 years of age and older, admitted to an ED in the Phoenix Metropolitan area with suicidal ideation, were voluntarily recruited for two weeks. The self-rated Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used as a baseline assessment along with the introduction of a safety plan. Participants were then followed with the receipt of postcards with caring messages over a two-week period, and a final SBQ-R. The SBQ-R has shown beneficial reliability and validity measuring suicidality in the adult population. Data from the pre-SBQ-R was analyzed using descriptive statistics as no post-SBQ-Rs were received. Outcomes for this project included a reduction in suicidal ideation and suicide risk. This project provides insight into the implementation of a safety plan and follow-up intervention in the ED and their attempts to reduce acute suicide risk as well as highlight the value that post-ED support provides. \\nKeywords: suicide, prevention, safety plan, caring messages, postcards, emergency department, follow-up, contacts, brief intervention'}], 'rights': 'http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NKC/1.0/', 'reuse': 'All Rights Reserved', 'subject': ['Suicide, Prevention, Emergency Department'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Guthery', 'roles': ['Teacher'], 'rest': 'Ann'}, {'last': 'Boothe', 'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Ryan'}], 'created': '2019-04-29', 'title': ['Implementing a safety plan and using Follow-up Postcards to Mitigate Suicide Risk in Patients in the Emergency Department']}"", ""embargo_date"": ""2020-05-01"", ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2019-04-30T01:46:57.923Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""~"", ""history_user"": null}}, {""model"": ""repo.historicalitem"", ""pk"": 733579, ""fields"": {""id"": 53151, ""created"": ""2019-04-30T01:46:57.388Z"", ""modified"": ""2019-04-30T01:46:57.388Z"", ""handle_registered"": false, ""label"": ""Implementing a safety plan and using Follow-up Postcards to Mitigate Suicide Risk in Patients in the Emergency Department"", ""item_enabled"": true, ""item_status"": 1, ""metadata"": ""{'description': [{'type': 'abstract', 'value': 'Suicide has become a national concern due to the increasing rates across the country.

Obesity is an endemic health issue in the U.S. and continues to gain concern for increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Benefits of physical activity are firmly established across healthcare disciplines to combat and prevent obesity, yet sedentary behaviors continue to be on the rise. The use of wearable technology, that provides real-time feedback of activity, has been identified as a promising tool for increasing physical activity.<br/><br/>Methods: Analysis of a subset of questions from a larger survey was used to evaluate wearable device attitudes and behavior changes over time. Convenience sample (n=10), ages >18, required enrollment in a clinic-based weight and wellness program (WWP) to participate. The survey questions assessed effectiveness of wearable device on a 0-10 motivation scale to increase physical activity and a self- assessment of behavioral changes at specific intervals over a 6-month period. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric, two-tailed tests will be used to analyze the data. Due to the necessity of detecting minute differences with the small sample size, the significance level will be tested at the p<0.10.<br/><br/>Results: Participants >18 years of age, enrolled in a WWP (n=10) included 20% male and 80% female.

ACP has been shown to improve communication and reduce discomfort for patients and their families. The literature supports utilizing formalized, multimodality training programs for healthcare providers in order to increase their confidence in initiating ACP discussions. These findings led to the initiation of an evidence-based practice project in a primary care setting with the purpose of increasing advance care planning discussions between providers and patients with the use of a standardized education tool. <br/><br/>Background and Significance: National regulations mandate that patients are provided information about advance directives in the healthcare setting, but completion rates are not monitored and continue to be low. ACP is now a billable service for healthcare providers, but it has not provided enough incentive to increase completion rates. Barriers for healthcare providers in the outpatient setting include lack of time, protocols, and lack of education on how to initiate and foster advance care planning discussions. <br/><br/>Methods: Healthcare providers in a primary care office attended a 15-minute structured educational session with and a toolkit was provided on the importance of ACP, how to initiate conversations with patients, and bill for the service. Participants completed a portion of the Knowledge, Attitudinal, and Experiential Survey on Advance Directives (KAESAD) survey assessing their confidence in ACP before and three months post intervention. Participant confidence (N = 6) in ACP was analyzed using the Wilcoxin test and descriptive statistics. The number of billed ACP services for the office was collected for four months post intervention and compared to the previous four months. Outcomes: A significant increase in provider confidence after participating in a multimodality education program was found in the results (Z = -2.21, p = .03). There was a 42.1% increase in the number of billed ACP discussions for the office in the four months post intervention. <br/><br/>Conclusion: The future desired state is that ACP discussions become standard practice in primary care leading to the completion of advance directives. This can be accomplished through formalized education sessions and resources for providers in order to increase their confidence in initiating ACP discussions with patients. The ultimate goal is to decrease unnecessary spending at end-of-life while improving patient and family satisfaction with the quality of care received at end-of-life.",,eng,,,Text,57 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2018-06-12 23:00:00.218738+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:24.612613+00:00,1,kpardon1,,49679.0,,"Smith, Arsena","Nunez, Diane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

ACP has been shown to improve communication and reduce discomfort for patients and their families. The literature supports utilizing formalized, multimodality training programs for healthcare providers in order to increase their confidence in initiating ACP discussions. These findings led to the initiation of an evidence-based practice project in a primary care setting with the purpose of increasing advance care planning discussions between providers and patients with the use of a standardized education tool. \\n\\nBackground and Significance: National regulations mandate that patients are provided information about advance directives in the healthcare setting, but completion rates are not monitored and continue to be low. ACP is now a billable service for healthcare providers, but it has not provided enough incentive to increase completion rates. Barriers for healthcare providers in the outpatient setting include lack of time, protocols, and lack of education on how to initiate and foster advance care planning discussions. \\n\\nMethods: Healthcare providers in a primary care office attended a 15-minute structured educational session with and a toolkit was provided on the importance of ACP, how to initiate conversations with patients, and bill for the service. Participants completed a portion of the Knowledge, Attitudinal, and Experiential Survey on Advance Directives (KAESAD) survey assessing their confidence in ACP before and three months post intervention. Participant confidence (N = 6) in ACP was analyzed using the Wilcoxin test and descriptive statistics. The number of billed ACP services for the office was collected for four months post intervention and compared to the previous four months. Outcomes: A significant increase in provider confidence after participating in a multimodality education program was found in the results (Z = -2.21, p = .03). There was a 42.1% increase in the number of billed ACP discussions for the office in the four months post intervention. \\n\\nConclusion: The future desired state is that ACP discussions become standard practice in primary care leading to the completion of advance directives.

Inftants in the first group (n=27) were all born prior to the start of the project and therefore were all treated with IV dextrose in the NICU after failing to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges with oral feedings alone.

Of those 27 infants, 24 received oral dextrose gel for NH treatment.  Of resipratory distress in addition to NH so these infants were excluded in the statistical analysis of NICU admissions.  Therefore the post-implementation group only had 2 admission for primary diagnosis of NH.  When comparing admission rates for hypoglycemia between the two groups, the first group had a 100% admission rate while the second group (those who received oral dextrose gel) only had a 9% admission rate for neonatal hypoglycemia (p<0.001).\\nUpon further investigation it was found that these 2 infants admitted to the NICU with the diagnosis of NH had multiple risk factors present, including being infants of diabetic mothers which means they likely experienced refractory hypoglycemia after treatment with oral dextrose gel secondary to hyperinsulinism.  Hyperinsulinism can lead to persistent and profound hypoglycemia in the newborn that is more difficult to treat, which is of clinical significance.\\n\\nImplications for Practice:  Early identification with timely follow-up blood glucose levels following intervention may be critical to successful treatment without requiring NICU admission.  Nursing education and parental support are also paramount to success.  If the change in NICU admissions for NH is statistically significant with a larger sample size, results may be shared with other facilities that traditionally transfer these infants for a higher level of care.\\n\\nImplications for Research:  Studies with larger sample size may generate more generalizable data with fewer outliers.  Studies comparing neurodevelopmental outcomes among infants who received different NH treatments are necessary to determine long-term safety.\""}], 'rights': 'All Rights Reserved', 'contributor': [{'last': 'Cruz', 'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Sylvia'}, {'last': 'LaBronte', 'roles': ['Mentor'], 'rest': 'Kimberly'}], 'title': ['Oral Dextrose Gel in the Treatment of Neonatal Hypoglycemia: An Evidence Based Practice Change'], 'extent': ['23 pages'], 'language': ['eng'], 'subject': ['Glucose', 'Administration, Oral', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infant, Newborn'], 'created': '2018-05-09'}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2018-05-30T23:13:23.419Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

94,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Advance Directives in Long-Term Care: Implementation of Five Wishes,48667,Advance Directives$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T048297||Long-Term Care$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T024263,Advance Directives||Long-Term Care,,2018-05-04,"Background and Purpose The lack of an advance directive (AD) can predispose a person to an aggressive course of treatment despite their wishes. When AD’s are incomplete, the chances of unwanted procedures, such as tube feedings and repeated transitioning between nursing homes and hospitals often result in the risk of increased mortality and morbidity, especially for older adults. Making end-of-life decisions can improve the quality of death by allowing individuals to make decisions to die in a dignified manner. The purpose of this project was to improve AD completion rates by implementing “Five Wishes” (FW) into the admission process in a long-term care facility (LTCF).<br/><br/>Methods The project took place on the skilled nursing units at a LTCF in Southwestern Arizona over a 2-month period of time. Twenty random charts were assessed before the start of the project to determine the residents AD status. Those 20 were then informed about FW’s and encouraged to complete one, along with all newly admitted residents to the skilled nursing units. Logs were used for data collection and each participating resident signed a HIPPA document. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and outcome variables.<br/>Outcomes Of the 20 current residents included in the quantitative chart assessment, 6 (30%) residents completed a FW’s document. Fifty residents were admitted during the project span and 21 (42%) of them completed FW’s.<br/><br/>Conclusions The FW’s completion rates were lower than expected. None of the residents had an AD more detailed than a basic full code or do not resuscitate (DNR) status before being informed of FW’s.

Although the HPV vaccine protects against transmission of the most common strains of HPV that cause genital warts and numerous urogenital cancers, uptake in the United States remains suboptimal. Failure to vaccinate leaves individuals vulnerable to the virus and subsequent complications of transmission. The evidence demonstrates that provider recommendation alone increases rates of vaccine uptake. The literature does not suggest a specific method for provider recommendation delivery; however, best practice alerts (BPAs) were correlated with increased vaccination rates. These findings have directed a proposed project that includes an electronic health record (EHR) change prompting internal medicine, family practice and women’s health providers to educate and recommend the HPV vaccine at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in the Southwest United States. The project demonstrates that after the implementation of a practice change of a HPV BPA in the EHR, HPV vaccination rates increased. Practice settings pre and post were similar, making the increase clinically significant. The strengths of this project include an increase in HPV vaccination rates, a sustainable intervention, and an intervention that can easily be replicated into other health maintenance tasks. There were some limitations including the BPA alert only catching the HPV 9 vaccine series and the BPA did not always capturing historical data.

99,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Open-Access Scheduling,48650,Emergency Rooms||Patient Satisfaction$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T050940||Appointments and Schedules$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T003254,Emergency Rooms||Patient Satisfaction||Appointments and Schedules,,2018-05-02,"Declaration of Conflicts: This project has no conflicts of interest to declare.<br/><br/>Context:  This project was completed at a federally qualified primary healthcare clinic in Phoenix, Arizona that served patients of all age groups, but primarily cared for the Hispanic population providing primary care, preventative services, family planning, two lab technicians, one promoter, two medical assistant supervisors, five front desk staff, one chief administrative officer, one chief financial officer, two medical directoers who were also providers at the clinic.<br/><br/>Problem and Analysis Assessment: During my clinical rotations, I saw the burden a missed patient appointment had not only on the patients themselves, but also on the clinic, providers, and the staff.  It caused delay in treatment for patients, and it did not allow other patients that wanted to be seen to be seen.  It also increased unnecessary costs and wasted provider time.  Thereafter, I met with some of the leadership team and one of the medical directors to determine a solution to reduce the number of missed appointments that were occurring.  An educational session was kept to discuss the findings of this problem to the providers and the staff and when surveys were handed out to the patients, providers, and staff to assess their satisfaction with the old scheduling system versus the new scheduling system, they were also provided with a cover letter discussing the project.<br/><br/>Intervention: In order for improvements in care to occur, a system process change including the way patients are scheduled must occur.  In this case, an open-access scheduling system (OAS) was implemented.  OAS allows a patient to schedule an appointment on the 'same-day' or the 'next-day' to be seen.  One provider at each of the clinics, each day of the week was available for 'same-day' appointments from 1300-1600.  The providers were still available for scheduled appointments using the previous scheduling method.  Walk-ins were still accepted, and were scheduled based on patient provider preference; however, if an appointment was not available for their preferred provider, they were typically seen with the provider that was the 'same-day' provider for that day.<br/><br/>Strategy for change:  Since patients were only allowed to schedule appointments one month in advance, only one month was needed to implement this process change.  A recommendation for the future would be to clearly identify the patient encounter type, and label it as a same-day appointment, as this would be helpful when gathering and extracting data for this type of patient group specifically.<br/><br/>Measurement of Improvement:  Over a three-month period, a data collection plan was used to determine the number of Mas over a three-month period before and after implementation of this change.  Satisfaction scores were measured using likert scales for patients, provider, and staff, and a dichotomous scale was used to determine the likelihood of emergency room or urgent care use.  A comparison was done to measure revenue during the same time frame.  During the three months, a clinically significant decrease in MAs was seen (<0.52%), with an increase in revenue by 41%.  Additionally, a statistically significant increase in patient, provider and staff satisfaction was also noted when compared to the old scheduling system, as >68% of all patients, providers and staff reported feeling either very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the new scheduling system.  Additionally, patients also reported that they were less likely to visit an emergency room(88%) or urgent care (90%) since they were able to be seen the same-day or the next-day by a provider.<br/><br/>Effects of changes: An incidental finding occurred during this study - where 877 more patients were seen in the three months during the implementation of this project, compared to the three months prior; which likely resulted in a 41% increase in revenue.  Additionally this project, allowed patients that wanted to be seen on the same day, to be seen, and it decreased unnecessary costs associated with emergency room or urgent care visits.  Some of the limitations involved included the current political environment, appointment slots that were previously 15 minutes in length (in 2016), increased to 20 minutes in length (in 2017), a language barrier was noted for the patient surveys since English was not the first language for many of the patients who completed the survey (although documents were translated), and the surveys used were not reliable instrument given that a reliable instrument in previous studies could not be found.<br/><br/>Lessons learnt:  In order to have accuracy of the survey results, it is best for the author of the study to hand out and provide scripture for the survey so that complete data is received from the surveyors.<br/><br/>Messages for others: Begin by making a small process change where only one provider allows for the open-access scheduling so that the entire office is not affected by it, and if results begin to look promising then it can be expanded.  Additionally, correct labeling of patients as 'same-day' is also important so that additional data can be gathered when needed regarding the 'same-day' patients.<br/><br/>Patient/Family/Guardian Involvement:  Patients who benefited from the new scheduling system (open-access scheduling) were asked to fill out a survey that asked them to disclose some demographic data and asked them to determine their satisfaction with the new vs old scheduling system and their likelihood of visiting an emergency room or urgent care.<br/><br/>Ethics Approval: Arizona State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) Received: September 2017",,eng,,,Text,62 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0,Public,,2018-05-09 17:22:37.523700+00:00,2018-06-21 18:49:02.163003+00:00,1,kpardon1,,48650.0,,"Patel, Dimple","Thrall, Charlotte","Uriri-Glover, Johannah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Additionally, a statistically significant increase in patient, provider and staff satisfaction was also noted when compared to the old scheduling system, as >68% of all patients, providers and staff reported feeling either very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the new scheduling system.

106,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Socio-emotional and Behavior Issues of Children Separated from Military Parent,48622,Children$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T007685||Military Family$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T859580||Coping,Children||Military Family||Coping,,2018-04-30,"Introduction: More than 1.2 million children in military families face long separations from a parent due to deployment or extended assignment, which can lead to significant family dysfunction as well as behavioral, emotional, and scholastic problems for the child. The purpose of From Caring 2 Coping is to identify and provide healthcare providers of military children tools to recognize and address maladaptive and externalizing behaviors of these children, while also assisting the nondeployed parent or caregiver to provide their children with the necessary support to reduce stress and increase their own coping skills. <br/><br/>Materials and Methods: After approval from Arizona State University IRB, children aged 4-11 years who are currently or forecasted to be separated from a military parent due to a deployment or extended assignment, were recruited from a military pediatric clinic along with their primary caregiver. An intervention was adapted from Bowen and Martin’s (2011) Resiliency Model of Role Performance for Service Members, Veterans, and their Families to identify and improve individual assets and family communication skills, find support through social connections, and prepare for potential stressors by constructing a Roadmap of Life. The Parental Stress Scale (PSS) and Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) were completed before and after the 4-week intervention along with a final caregiver survey to evaluate the caregiver’s perceptions of From Caring 2 Coping. <br/><br/>Results: Four mothers and eight children completed the program for which Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test compared results from pre- and post PSC-17 surveys from the children showing significant improvement post-intervention (p = 0.017). The post PSC-17 results were compared to post PSS results with Spearman Correlation Coefficient, r = 0.949, that is statistically significant (p = 0.05). From Caring 2 Coping is rated as an effective program by parents in a postintervention survey that is easy to incorporate into daily activities. Parents ranked highest satisfaction through use of the Family Communication Plan and Family Timeline. <br/><br/>Conclusions: From Caring 2 Coping intervention tools improved family communication, use of individual assets and Roadmap of Life coping skills, thereby improving child and caregiver coping response as evidenced by improved PSC-17 and PSS scores.

Evidence suggests the importance of implementing a severity stratification tool to improve early identification of SSTI’s. The aim of this evidence based project is to examine if educating healthcare staff on the use of a severity stratification tool would increase staff knowledge of SSTI's. The sample consisted of 18 participants, 12 healthcare providers and 6 healthcare staff at a correctional facility in the Southwestern United States. A pre-and posttest design, including an educational session was implemented. A 14-item multiple choice self-developed questionnaire was used to evaluate participants’ knowledge of identifying and ranking SSTI’s using the CREST tool. A one tail paired t-test was performed to compare the pre-and post-test case study scores for the healthcare provider group. A significant increase from pre-test to post-test case study scores was found (t(13)= -6.19, p < 0.00). Of the healthcare providers, 57% found the tool “moderately helpful.” Of the non-provider sample, 50% found the tool “extremely helpful” and plan to use the tool “all of the time.” The findings of this study suggest that implementing an educational session on a wound severity stratification tool improves staff knowledge and increases the likelihood of the tool being used in practice.

These injuries worsen when athletes over train, make physical contact, and do not take enough time for rest between injuries. Protocols and therapies need to be implemented to prevent subsequent injuries, including progressive measurement of rehabilitation and return to play (RTP) outcomes. The goal of treatment for these athletes is to return them to their previous level of performance and prevent re-injury. <br/><br/>The purpose of this quality improvement evidence-based project was to determine if the use of the Pediatric Adolescent Shoulder Survey (PASS) affects return to play. The aims of this project were to determine if there was a change in return to play (RTP) outcomes, compare length of RTP between operative and non-operative groups, and determine if PASS scores improved over time.<br/><br/>Methods<br/>The PASS is a 13 item, patient reported outcomes (PROs) survey assessing symptoms, limitations, compensatory mechanisms, and emotional distress. It is reliable and valid for athletes who have acute shoulder injuries and decreased range of motion or strength. <br/><br/>After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the institution and university, providers at a southwestern sports medicine clinic were educated on administration and scoring of the survey. Surveys were administered to athletes ages 8-18 who presented with shoulder injuries at intervals. Retrospective and prospective chart reviews were obtained at baseline (control group) and post intervention (intervention group). Return to play (RTP) days and Pediatric Adolescent Shoulder Survey scores were recorded.<br/><br/>Results <br/>Independent t-tests were calculated to compare mean RTP days from control and intervention groups, RTP for operative and non-operative groups within the control and intervention groups. Statistically significant t (20) = -2.827, p = 0.03) differences were noted between operative group for the intervention group, (n=9), M=136.00 (SD=51.49) days vs non-operative group, M= 83.68 (SD=31.78) days. No statistically significant difference between control group M =118.68 (SD=55.95) days and intervention group M=107.52 (48.77) days was noted. PASS scores showed improvement over time. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>The PASS instrument may positively affect RTP. There was a significant change in RTP for the whole group. Non-operative patients RTP sooner than operative for the whole sample.

Studies examining effects of IP with patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have shown improvement in A1C, blood pressure, lipids, self-efficacy and overall greater knowledge of disease process and management. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the impact of IP with attention to identifying and addressing social needs of patients with T2DM.  Participants at least 18 years of age with an A1C >6.5% were identified; Spanish speaking patients were included in this project. The intervention included administration of Health Leads questionnaire to assess social needs. Monthly in person or phone meetings were conducted during a 3-month period. The patient had the option to meet with the doctor of nursing practice (DNP) student as well as other members of the team including the clinical pharmacist and social work intern. Baseline A1C levels were extracted from chart at 1st monthly meeting. Post A1C levels were drawn at the 3 month follow up with their primary care provider. Study outcomes include the difference in A1C goal attainment, mean A1C and patient satisfaction.  Pre A1C levels in participants ranged from 7.1% to 9.8% with a mean of 8.3%. Post A1C levels ranged from 6.9% to 8.6% with a mean of 7.7%. Two cases were excluded as they did not respond to the intervention. A paired-samples t test was calculated to compare the mean pre A1C level to the post A1C level. The mean pre A1C level was 8.24 (sd .879), and the post A1C level was 7.69 (sd .631). A significant decrease from pre to post A1C levels was found (t (6) = 2.82, p<.05). The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is on the rise, as are the costs. This nation’s healthcare system must promote interprofessional collaboration and do a better job of addressing SDOH to more effectively engage patients in the management of their disease.",,eng,,,Text,26 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2018-05-02 18:05:13.393061+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:24.332240+00:00,1,kpardon1,,48523.0,,"Torres, Julia Patricia","Moffett, Carol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Approximately one- half of all Hispanic DM patients utilize community health clinics for their DM needs. Evidence suggests that using a culturally-tailored approach to DM education can uniquely improve health outcomes in this population. The purpose of this evidence-based practice (EBP) project was to improve glycemic control in a medically underserved Hispanic community through a culturally-tailored DM education program. <br/><br/>Methods: This quasi-experimental pre/post design project was guided by the ACE Star Model and Leininger’s Theory of Cultural Care. The affiliated University’s IRB approved this project. The Diabetes Empowerment Education Program (DEEP) was implemented in a free, community clinic in a medically underserved area. Spanish speaking patients (n = 15) with A1C levels <br/>> 8mg/dl were recruited to participate in a 6-week group educational program facilitated by community health workers. Outcomes included A1C levels, weight, and two surveys from the Michigan Diabetes Research Center - DM knowledge test and the DM empowerment scale. <br/><br/>Results: Paired sample t-tests were used to analyze the outcomes. The participants had an average pre-A1C of 8.82 mg/dl with post-A1C of 8.01 mg/dl (p = .028). Pre-knowledge test scores averaged 9.40 with post-test average of 12.07 (p < .001).

Despite the proven safety and value of PrEP treatment, use remains low in practice. Research has shown that low clinical use corresponds to low levels of understanding of PrEP among providers. Academic detailing is a method of innovation diffusion through provider education that results in changes in knowledge and practice. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of academic detailing on primary care provider knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to prescribe PrEP.<br/><br/>Methods: An academic detailing session was provided by the Florida Department of Health in Broward County to primary care providers (PCPs) at a private clinic in the Southeastern US. The Conceptual Model of Nursing and Population Health (CMNPH) and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services Framework (PARIHS) were used as guides for project design and evidence-based practice implementation. There were five participants in the academic detailing session including: a physician, a physician assistant (PA), and three medical students. PCP PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured using pre and post intervention surveys. PrEP prescription, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) screening, and HIV testing were measured using aggregate data queries for the time periods of four and eight weeks before and four and eight weeks after the educational intervention. No personal identifying information was obtained.<br/><br/>Results: Pre and post surveys were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank testing to examine differences between matched pairs of ordinal data. Significant PrEP screening and HIV/STI testing were analyzed pre and post intervention using paired t tests to compare pre and post intervention practices. Significant differences were found in the results (Z = 2.03, 1.84, and 1.83 respectively, p > 0.1) The academic detailing intervention significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers and medical students regarding PrEP. The mean of active qualifying ICD 10 codes prior to the intervention versus post intervention were 5 (sd = 5.64) vs. 4.2 (sd = 4.87) respectively. No significant difference was found between active ICD 10 codes for patient visits before compared to after the intervention (t (9) = 1.12, p>.1).<br/><br/>Conclusions: This project found that academic detailing improved provider self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding PrEP. However, self-reported survey scores were not correlated with changes in clinical practice based on ICD 10 codes.

There were five participants in the academic detailing session including: a physician, a physician assistant (PA), and three medical students. PCP PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured using pre and post intervention surveys. PrEP prescription, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) screening, and HIV testing were measured using aggregate data queries for the time periods of four and eight weeks before and four and eight weeks after the educational intervention. No personal identifying information was obtained.\\n\\nResults: Pre and post surveys were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank testing to examine differences between matched pairs of ordinal data. Significant PrEP screening and HIV/STI testing were analyzed pre and post intervention using paired t tests to compare pre and post intervention practices. Significant differences were found in the results (Z = 2.03, 1.84, and 1.83 respectively, p > 0.1) The academic detailing intervention significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers and medical students regarding PrEP. The mean of active qualifying ICD 10 codes prior to the intervention versus post intervention were 5 (sd = 5.64) vs. 4.2 (sd = 4.87) respectively. No significant difference was found between active ICD 10 codes for patient visits before compared to after the intervention (t (9) = 1.12, p>.1).\\n\\nConclusions: This project found that academic detailing improved provider self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding PrEP. However, self-reported survey scores were not correlated with changes in clinical practice based on ICD 10 codes. Additional clinical implications may include fostering clinical outreach and cooperation between the county health department and local primary care clinics. Further research is needed on the effects of PrEP academic detailing on clinical practice.'}], 'type': ['Text'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Schlumbrecht', 'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Benjamin'}, {'last': 'Link', 'roles': ['Mentor'], 'rest': 'Denise'}], 'title': ['A Quality Improvement Project Implementing PrEP Academic Detailing to Impact Provider Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior in a Primary Care Setting'], 'extent': ['50 pages'], 'language': ['eng'], 'subject': ['Academic Detailing', 'Education', 'HIV', 'Population Health', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis', 'Prevention'], 'rights': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0', 'created': '2018-04-18'}"", ""embargo_date"": ""2019-04-22"", ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2018-04-25T18:29:58.278Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

Prior studies suggest sponsorship may equally be impactful as attending 12-step meetings. <br/><br/>Design: The primary hypothesis was that active participation as defined by contact with a sponsor of an hour or more per week, as measured by the impact on affective characteristics correlated with increased levels of sobriety, when measured by the AWARE questionnaire (Advance Warning of Relapse) within 7 days of entry and prior to discharge (within 30 days). Setting: The project took place in a residential treatment facility in Phoenix, Arizona. <br/><br/>Participants: There were 12 clients from a men’s house and 12 clients from a woman’s house, all of which were going through recovery.

The purpose of this project was to investigate how enhanced prenatal education and concurrent scheduling of a well-baby visit at four weeks, instead of the traditional six weeks, could increase adherence to recommended follow-up care at a federally qualified health clinic in the Southwestern United States. The Theory of Reasoned Action guided the intervention while Rosswurum and Larrabee\u2019s evidence-based practice model was used to develop the project. The pre-existing weekly prenatal education program was enhanced with information regarding the importance of a four-week postpartum follow-up visit. Front desk schedulers were educated to offer same day appointments for the postpartum care visit and one-month well-baby appointment. Data collection took place for three months after implementation of the project and was compared to adherence rates during the three months prior to the intervention.

It can be difficult for clinicians to manage these symptoms while balancing patient safety concerns and preferences. Shared decision-making (SDM) can assist both the provider and patient to navigate the various treatment options, minimizing gaps between their preferences. To assess the effect of SDM in a nurse-led practice in the Southwest, two nurse practitioners (NP) were invited to use a menopausal decision aid (DA). Women aged 40 to 64 years experiencing VMS were invited to participate in the project. Following a visit with the NP in which the DA was used, patients completed a six question post-intervention survey based on both the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and SDM-Q-9 surveys. Patients were also asked to complete a telephone interview about the process 1-2 weeks post-intervention. The NP completed a post-intervention survey based on the SDM-Q-Doc to assess clinician satisfaction with the SDM process. Eight patients (mean age, 47.9 years), presenting with a range of 2 to 6 perimenopausal symptoms participated in the project. All patients (100%) strongly or completely agreed that the clinician precisely explained the advantages & disadvantages of treatment options, helped them understand all the information, reached an agreement on how to proceed with care, and were extremely satisfied or satisfied with their decision and making an informed choice. Both clinicians completely agreed they had come to an agreement on how to proceed, and completely or strongly agreed they helped the patient understand all information. There was a correlation between the use of SDM patient’s age, making an informed choice, and being satisfied with their decision.  Incorporating a perimenopausal DA can enhance patient and clinician satisfaction with SDM to understand their treatment options and make an informed menopausal decision.",,eng,,,Text,20 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,2018-07-01,2017-05-24 20:13:16.494850+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:24.220415+00:00,1,kpardon1,,43848.0,,"Puttbrese, AnnMarie","Link, Denise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Shared decision-making (SDM) can assist both the provider and patient to navigate the various treatment options, minimizing gaps between their preferences. To assess the effect of SDM in a nurse-led practice in the Southwest, two nurse practitioners (NP) were invited to use a menopausal decision aid (DA). Women aged 40 to 64 years experiencing VMS were invited to participate in the project. Following a visit with the NP in which the DA was used, patients completed a six question post-intervention survey based on both the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and SDM-Q-9 surveys. Patients were also asked to complete a telephone interview about the process 1-2 weeks post-intervention. The NP completed a post-intervention survey based on the SDM-Q-Doc to assess clinician satisfaction with the SDM process. Eight patients (mean age, 47.9 years), presenting with a range of 2 to 6 perimenopausal symptoms participated in the project.

Available evidence demonstrated a decrease in non-urgent transports with potential for significant savings to the healthcare system. This study was conducted in a community where 86.3% of residents are over the age of 65. The local fire department employed a full time APN who evaluated patients identified by EMS crews as at risk for repeat use of the 911 system.

Interventions included assistance reducing safety concerns, assistance with coordination of care, and working with patient primary care providers to meet patient needs. Data collection included patient age, gender, number of 911 calls 30 days prior and 30 days post intervention, number of ambulance transports following intervention and PEI score after the initial APN visit.

Readmissions can be reduced or prevented by providing a safe transition through care coordination and enhanced communication. Research demonstrates implementation of APRN led home visits (HV) along with telephonic follow-up are cost effective and can be utilized for reducing readmissions among HF patients.<br/><br/>Methods: A program was designed with an ACO and carried out in a family practice clinic with a group of seven HF patients older than 50 years who were at risk of readmission. Interventions included weekly HV with supplemental telephonic calls by the APRN student along with a physician assistant for 12 weeks. Readmission data was collected. QOL and SCB were measured using “Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire” (MLHFQ) and “European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale” respectively. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Friedman Test.<br/><br/>Outcomes: There were no hospital readmissions at 30 days and the interventions demonstrated a positive effect on QOL, self-care management and satisfaction (χ2 = 30.35, p=.000).

Patients in an outpatient GI practice in Southwestern United States with chronic functional GI symptoms were shown an educational video regarding the origins and benefits of using probiotics to manage chronic symptoms. Knowledge of probiotics, self-efficacy and willingness to utilize probiotics was measured by asking participants to complete a modified Health Belief Model survey before and after viewing the video. Patient demographics were collected. There were 75 participants (n=75) who participated in the project with a mean age of 40.3 years (SD=15.41), 85% female and 15% male. Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze changes in paired data with significant improvements in self-efficacy (Z=3.93, p< .01), benefits of probiotic use (Z=4.33, p<.01) and decreased barriers to probiotics use (Z=-4.31, p<.01). After participants viewed the educational video, 95% of patients indicated they would try probiotics (CI 95%, p<.01) versus 65% of patients who would try probiotics before viewing video.

Screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a proven, effective tool in reducing alcohol use; however it is severely underutilized due to barriers such as provider time constraints and lack of confidence. Numerous missed opportunities exist regarding screening and early intervention, which could significantly improve patient outcomes. An SBIRT pilot utilizing student-mediated brief interventions could serve to increase provider confidence and awareness, as well as overcome time constraint barriers. <br/><br/>Purpose: The purpose is to implement an SBIRT pilot at a campus clinic, utilizing nurse practioner (NP) students to conduct universal alcohol screens and brief interventions (BI) as a means to overcome barriers to accepting an evidenced based practice. <br/><br/>Methods: Intervention group (IG) of two providers were matched with NP students to perform screens and BI’s (n=111), while a comparison group (CG) of three providers conducted usual care (n=41). Single question screens were administered universally, followed by an AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and BI for positive screens. A pre/post pilot provider attitude survey was administered to gauge provider acceptance. <br/><br/>Results: Of 109 patients screened, 52% tested positive requiring a full AUDIT, 56% of AUDITS were positive requiring BI’s, 88% agreed to a BI, and 93% agreed to reduce alcohol intake.

Social support may improve health empowerment and lead to increased perception of well-being.<br/><br/>Purpose: The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of social support provided by a cancer support agency on health empowerment and perceived well-being in adults impacted by cancer.<br/><br/>Conceptual Framework: The Health Empowerment Theory maintains that perceived wellbeing is the desired outcome; mediated by health empowerment through social support, personal growth, and purposeful participation in active goal attainment.<br/><br/>Methods: Twelve adults impacted by cancer agreed to complete online questionnaires at<br/>baseline and at 12 weeks after beginning participation in social support programs provided by a cancer support agency. <br/>Instruments included: Patient Empowerment Scale, The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), and The Office of National Statistics (ONS) Subjective Well-Being Questions.<br/><br/>Results: Four participants completed pre and post surveys.

The effectiveness of the program\\ncompared the percentage of patients immunized from August - December 2016 to 2015.\\n\\nResults: Post intervention, 44% of the clinic patients were immunized against influenza,\\ncompared to 18% (pre-intervention).

Outcome measures included: 1) provider knowledge, beliefs, and confidence measured pre- and post-intervention; and 2) electronic health record documentation of provider adherence to guideline recommendations one, two, and three months post-intervention.\\n\\nRESULTS: Four providers participated in the intervention. The mean total score for the provider beliefs and knowledge from a 5-point Likert scale demonstrated a positive increase after the intervention (14.75 vs. 23.25, p = .068). The mean total provider confidence score achieved near significance as well (12.25 vs. 21.75, p = .066). Resultant behavior change in the providers did not reach statistical significance when the electronic health records of all adolescent well visits over a three-month period were assessed. Screening for depression at adolescent well visits\\nADOLESCENT DEPRESSION 3\\nincreased from 0% to 84-90% post-intervention. Setting treatment goals upon detection of depression increased from 0% to 41% (p = .089). Providers appropriately administered active support 67% of the time when a patient was identified with mild depressive symptomology post-intervention. Providers complied with guideline recommendations with identified cases of moderate and severe depression (n = 2).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Pediatric primary care providers demonstrated some positive behavioral changes towards integrating behavioral healthcare into their practice after an educational session on the guidelines for adolescent depression.'}], 'type': ['Text'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Huftalin', 'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Tori'}, {'last': 'Jacobson', 'roles': ['Mentor'], 'rest': 'Diana'}], 'title': ['Adolescent Depression: Integrating Behavioral Healthcare in a Pediatric Primary Care Setting'], 'extent': ['20 pages'], 'language': ['eng'], 'subject': ['Behavioral Health', 'Primary Care', 'Depression', 'Adolescent'], 'rights': 'All Rights Reserved', 'created': '2017-04-04'}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2017-05-15T23:32:08.245Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

Provider recruitment strategies offering loan repayment have had some success in the short term, but are less impactful at creating a long-term retention rate, unless the providers have an existing connection to either the community in which they are working or rural healthcare (Renner et al., 2010). Responding to this data, a demonstration project has been created in Colorado to test a rural focused “grow your own” advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) model. This model is designed to recruit RNs from inside rural communities to return to school and become primary care providers within those communities upon graduation. The project offers stipend support with assistance in the school application process, educational support, clinical and job placement assistance, and monthly coaching. Additionally, communities are asked to provide matching funds to support the APRN students with a goal of creating a self-sustaining model that will build a continuous pipeline of APRN providers. This strategy avoids the costly need to recruit and relocate providers who have no ties to the community. The initial response from rural nurses and communities around the state has been overwhelmingly successful.

Undiagnosed, uncontrolled diabetes in pregnancy can lead to maternal and infant health comorbidities as well as have adverse long-term effects for mother or baby. Although routine screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs between 24 and 28 weeks gestation, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends screening earlier in pregnancy for women at risk for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Risk factors include previous history of GDM, known impaired glucose metabolism, or obesity (BMI > 30). The purpose of this project is to implement the clinical practice guideline for early maternal glucose screening during pregnancy in women with risk factors through the integration of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool in an electronic health record (EHR). CDS tools can be utilized as a point of care strategy to remind providers of the clinical practice guidelines and to assist providers in decision-making related to screening.

Older adults are at an increased risk for developing sepsis, especially when age is combined with any type of compromising factor, such as chronic illness, recent hospitalizations, wounds, or invasive devices. Current evidence demonstrates that sepsis screening is effective for early identification of sepsis. Early identification of sepsis improves time to treatment initiation, which improves outcomes.<br/><br/>Methods: An evidence-based, provider approved clinical guideline was developed for a post-acute care facility after an extensive review of the literature. Upon implementation, brief educational sessions were provided to direct patient care staff. Participants completed pre- and post-tests as well as a demographic survey. A satisfaction survey was administered 30 days post intervention. A paired samples t-test was used to analyze the difference in test scores. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationship between staff comfort levels and the clinical guideline.<br/><br/>Results: The samples included 25 participants in the educational intervention and 18 in the satisfaction survey. There was a significant difference in the scores between pre-test (M = 72.3, SD = 12.43) and post-test scores (M = 86.6, SD = 10.2); t(24) = -5.578, p < 0.001.

This outcome is clinically significant as patients in this setting represent a vulnerable population.\""}], 'language': ['eng'], 'subject': ['Transition to Practice', 'Nurse Practicioner', 'Physician Assistant', 'Advanced Practice Provider', 'Orientation'], 'rights': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0', 'contributor': [{'last': 'Krzywicki', 'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Erin'}, {'last': \""Porter-O'Grady\"", 'roles': ['Mentor'], 'rest': 'Tim'}, {'last': 'Nunez', 'roles': ['Mentor'], 'rest': 'Diane'}], 'created': '2017-04-29', 'title': [\""Using a Clinical Guideline Coupled with Education to Improve Healthcare Providers' Knowledge of Early Sepsis Recognition in the Post-Acute Care Setting: A Quality Improvement Project\""]}"", ""embargo_date"": ""2018-05-12"", ""collection"": 260, ""history_date"": ""2017-05-03T19:47:09.926Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

156,260.0,Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection,Cystic Fibrosis Education for School Personnel,38113,Cystic Fibrosis$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T010315||Children$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T007685||Education||Schools$$http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/T037260,Cystic Fibrosis||Children||Education||Schools,,2016-05-06,"Aim. The purpose of this project was to determine if educating elementary school personnel would improve their knowledge and self-efficacy in caring for students with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and improve the health and educational outcomes of students with this disease.<br/>Background. Evidence suggests that teachers play a big role in the management of students with chronic illnesses. However, current literature indicates that teachers lack basic knowledge about childhood chronic illnesses and how to manage students with chronic illnesses. Synthesis of evidence indicated that an online CF educational intervention would improve knowledge and self-efficacy among school personnel, thereby improving the health and educational outcomes of students with CF.<br/>Methods. Elementary school personnel in Southern Arizona were asked to do an online pre-survey to evaluate knowledge and self-efficacy, view a short presentation on cystic fibrosis, and complete a post-survey. Parents of students with CF were asked to track 504 plan use and CF related absences. Frequencies were used to evaluate participant demographic data and survey data. The McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Test were used to analyze survey data.<br/>Results. Analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in perceived knowledge (p = .024) and self-efficacy scores (p = .034). Although survey scores showed an average score improvement between pre-survey and post-survey total scores (p = .212), it was not statistically significant.<br/>Conclusion.

Arthritis is the leading cause of disability among American adults, with over 50 million individuals affected. The Latino population experiences a disproportionate incidence of disability attributable to arthritis compared to other populations. Evidence supports self-management education incorporating physical activity as a promising intervention for arthritis. <br/>Methods<br/>The intervention included a curriculum developed by the Arthritis Association, three teaching sessions, and a pre/post-test. Anticipated outcomes included decreased pain measured by the Pain Visual Numeric, decreased report of disability measured by the Stanford HAQ, and increased self-efficacy measured by the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale.  The setting was a faith-based medical clinic that services the uninsured population located within Southwest Arizona. Participants included Spanish and English speaking adults diagnosed with arthritis.<br/>Results<br/>Twelve participants were consented however, only eight participants completed the entire project. Although the mean pain score decreased, indicating reduced pain, it was not statistically significant (pretest- M=5.75 SD=3.19; posttest- M=5.25 SD=2.82; z (7)=-.11, p= .92). However, there was a statistically significant increase in reports of exercise after the intervention (pretest M=.83, SD=.39; posttest- M=.43, SD=.53; z (6)=-2.0, p =.046). This was in response to an non validated question developed by the primary investigator and co-investigator of, “Do you currently exercise?”.<br/>Conclusions 	<br/>Results include increases in reports of exercise post-intervention and decreased pain. The use of non-pharmacological interventions such as self-management to reduce pain and increase mobility in arthritic patients can help lessen the socioeconomic health disparity gaps.",,eng,,,Text,100 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2016-05-06 22:41:34.965658+00:00,2018-06-21 18:46:23.974183+00:00,1,,,38111.0,,"Kerth, Sonja|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb98061351","Velasquez, Donna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Specific objectives included: 1) Gather and analyze participant demographic information and program utilization by participants for a non-profit cancer support agency, 2) Assess the extent to which those using the support programs experience perceived social support (PSS) and quality of life (QOL), and 3) Assess the utility of the survey process and selected instruments to guide program planning.<br/>Background: Obtaining the diagnosis of cancer is traumatic, but support groups assist in emotional healing among group members. There is strong evidence correlating support group participation with PSS and QOL. The Wilson and Cleary model of QOL clearly links social support and QOL and provided the conceptual framework for this project. <br/>Methods: A survey for self-reported participant demographics, support activities, QOL scores, and PSS scores was implemented. Both online and pencil and paper surveys were available. Instruments included the Flanagan Quality of Life Scale (Cronbach’s α = .82 to .92) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) and a demographic survey created for this project. <br/>Outcomes: All but one survey was completed online (n=48).

Specific objectives included: 1) Gather and analyze participant demographic information and program utilization by participants for a non-profit cancer support agency, 2) Assess the extent to which those using the support programs experience perceived social support (PSS) and quality of life (QOL), and 3) Assess the utility of the survey process and selected instruments to guide program planning.\\nBackground: Obtaining the diagnosis of cancer is traumatic, but support groups assist in emotional healing among group members. There is strong evidence correlating support group participation with PSS and QOL. The Wilson and Cleary model of QOL clearly links social support and QOL and provided the conceptual framework for this project. \\nMethods: A survey for self-reported participant demographics, support activities, QOL scores, and PSS scores was implemented. Both online and pencil and paper surveys were available. Instruments included the Flanagan Quality of Life Scale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .82 to .92) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.91) and a demographic survey created for this project. \\nOutcomes: All but one survey was completed online (n=48).

The overarching goal was to change dietary intake and improve exercise to reduce the incidence, prevalence, and impact of comorbidities associated with obesity. Background/Synthesis: Obesity is a significant epidemic facing the nation today with multiple impacts on the national healthcare system. There is often an association between obesity and endocrine disorders such as type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Both obesity and diabetes cost the nation billions of dollars annually in healthcare costs. Evidence shows that lifestyle modifications related to nutrition and physical activity are effective in weight reduction and prevention of chronic disease, especially when given by a healthcare provider. Methods: Fifteen adult patients at an endocrinology office in Arizona received individual counseling using the teach-back method focusing on health promotion behaviors through nutrition and exercise with a two-week follow-up phone call. Short-term outcomes measured in this project included changes in dietary intake and exercise behaviors through a pre- and post-test adapted from an obesity-screening tool developed by Greenwood et al. (2008). Outcomes/Results: Participants were primarily Caucasian and Hispanic, married, female, average age of 50 years, average BMI of 34.5, and some college education. There was a statistically significant increase in health promoting behavior on posttest scores (M=66, SD=6.23, range=58-76) compared to pretest scores (M=61, SD=4.72, range=50-66), t(14)=-2.55, p=0.023. Conclusions and Implications: Overall, patient health promotion behaviors increased with this educational intervention. Clinical implications include a potential decrease in patient comorbidities related to overweight and obesity. Implications for the greater healthcare system include decreased comorbidities, utilization of healthcare resources, and costs associated with overweight and obesity. Future recommendations would include determining weight and BMI changes over a longer period of time for even better outcome measures.<br/>	Keywords: obesity, obese, overweight, health promotion, health education, diet, exercise, nutrition",,eng,,,Text,55 pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0,Public,2018-05-01,2016-05-06 21:56:43.998605+00:00,2018-06-21 18:47:52.350306+00:00,3,,,38107.0,,"DeVeau, Kristina","Velasquez, Donna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Participants (n = 5) were Latino patients of a local community health care center who were overweight and medically at risk due to unhealthy lifestyles that were determined through a screening test. The 4-week clinical pathway program used motivational interviewing in one-on-one sessions every other week, and implemented the “Your Heart, Your Life” curriculum the other weeks.  One expected outcome included lower anthropometric measurement numbers of participants’ WL, BMI, WC, and BP. Another expected outcome was an increase in physical activity. Participants were also expected to earn a higher score on a post-test about nutrition and healthy living. A paired t-test and power analyses were used to assess its effectiveness. Results indicated significant decrease in weight loss (t [5] = 3.68, p = .0211, Cohen’s dz=1.647).

Background and Significance:  Patients experiencing mental illness are more likely to have multiple risk factors for chronic illness and die at a younger age than the general population.  Patients with mental illness face negative attitudes and stigma surrounding their disease process.  A literature review indicated that nurses in acute care settings often lack knowledge and perceived competence when caring for patients with co-morbid mental and physical illness, and express a negative attitude towards patients experiencing mental illness.  <br/><br/>Methods:  The Attitudes Towards Acute Mental Health (33) questionnaire was used to measure the attitudes of 36 new graduate registered nurses working in acute care before and after they participated in a two-hour educational program.  Data was analyzed using a paired t-test.  <br/><br/>Outcomes:  A paired-samples t test was calculated to compare the mean pre-test score to the mean post-test score of the ATAMH (33).  The mean on the pre-test was 165.95 (sd = 10.88), and the mean on the post-test was 153.92 (sd = 9.14).  A significant decrease from pre-test to post-test ATAMH (33) scores was found (t(36) = 6.03, p <.001).

Depression is a common reason for this underutilization and may coexist in up to 48% of patients.  By increasing screening for coexistent depression in patients with chronic joint pain using interprofessional collaboration (IPC), depression can be detected.  If managed appropriately patients may interrupt the pain-depression cycle, increase utilization of physical activity and thereby improve outcomes for chronic joint pain sufferers.<br/><br/>Purpose/Aims:  The purpose of this project was to increase the rate of depression screening for patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders in the physical therapy setting.<br/><br/>Methods: The institutional review board at Arizona State University approved this study with exempt status.  <br/><br/>Depression screening with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was completed by adult clients in three outpatient physical therapy clinics in the Midwest and Southwest United States (n=165).  Degree of depression and patient response rates were measured and analyzed using descriptive statistics.  <br/><br/>Staff were surveyed prior to and post project completion regarding their viewpoints on IPC and depression in this patient population.   Staff demographics were analyzed and they were evaluated on their change in perception of the problem and their likelihood of sustainability with a Wilcoxin Signed Ranks Test.  <br/><br/>Outcomes: Patient response rate was 91.5% (n=165) exposing a mean PHQ-9 score of 5.01 (mild depression).  More notably, patients whom had an existing diagnosis of depression had a mean PHQ-9 score 10.47 (moderate depression) indicating poorly controlled symptoms. <br/><br/>After an educational session to increase knowledge, staff perception of the problem did not significantly change, with a mean score of 2.25 out of 5 predicting “somewhat” likelihood of project sustainability. <br/><br/>Conclusion:  Implementing a PHQ-2 rather than PHQ-9 depression screening into patient’s electronic medical records would resolve staff and patient concerns of time consumption while simultaneously improving the rates of depression screening and management in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders.",,eng,,,,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,2017-09-01,2016-05-02 21:23:29.908037+00:00,2018-07-19 22:32:59.088255+00:00,0,,,38008.0,,"McKiver, Megan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Educating NPs that provide medical weight loss on basic MI counseling techniques is necessary to facilitate the use of this intervention.\\nMethods: NP providers at a group of seven medical weight loss clinics in the southwestern United States completed an online MI educational module that was developed for this project.  The module content covered basic MI counseling techniques. MI knowledge was assessed using a 6-item pre/post-test. Participants completed an 8-item course evaluation to provide additional feedback. \\nResults: Ten of the 13 NPs eligible participated in the project. The overall response to the project was positive as demonstrated by high scores on the course evaluation.

Healthcare professionals are among the most stressed of any profession, and mental health workers are at an extremely high risk for burnout and compassion fatigue (Christopher & Meris, 2010) with an estimated 21% to 67% of mental health workers reporting that they experience high levels of burnout (Salyers et al., 2011). After researching the literature, it was evident that practicing mindfulness can lead to less stress and higher job satisfaction. In an effort to combat this problem, an on-site mindfulness intervention was implemented at an outpatient psychiatric setting for eight weeks. Twenty-seven mental health workers gave their consent to be part of the study, and eleven were able to complete the study and self-assessment surveys for three time periods. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (the Human Service Version) and a 1-item job satisfaction were used to measure the effect of intervention on employees’ levels of stress and job satisfaction. A non-parametric Friedman test of differences among repeated measures was conducted and findings were not significant when comparing the average total scores of means between pre-, post-, or 1-month follow-up for Emotional Exhaustion (p = .148), Depersonalization (p = .223), Personal Achievement (p = .784) and job satisfaction (p = .422).

General knowledge about the disease and its risk factors and prevention are significant variables to adopt health-promoting behaviors.  Lifestyle change intervention has been shown to be effective with the risk reduction behaviors in prediabetic population.  However, it can be a daunting task to translate during short office visits.  <br/><br/>Methods: Sixteen participants with risk for prediabetes or diagnosed prediabetes enrolled into a 5-minute education session in a rural health clinic.  They received follow-up phone calls weekly for 4 weeks.  Demographics, PA, EH and SE levels were measured before the education session.  During the fourth week, PA, EH and SE were measured again.  Frequency, descriptive analysis, and paired t-test were used for data analysis.  <br/><br/>Outcomes: The mean age of participants was 56.6  13.0 years.  Approximately 81% were female, and 62.5% identified as Caucasian.  Over 80% reported married, and 56.3% described their health condition as good.  The three quarters (75%) noted they have heard of the term prediabetes.

Research involving non-behavioral health nurses, and medical and nursing students, sought to identify bias and negative attitudes directed towards psychiatric patients in a non-psychiatric setting. Studies were reviewed to determine the effects of educational interventions to teach empathy and increase knowledge related to the pathology of, and treatment modalities for, psychiatric patients. Several scales were used to measure bias and rate interventions to minimize it. Studies found that healthcare personnel, including nurses, are considered by mental health consumers to be primary contributors to stigma and discrimination against those with mental illness. The studies also discovered that participation in an educational intervention to learn empathy and acquire knowledge about psychiatric patients directly decreased bias. The project utilized the evidence-based practice PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PPM) supported by Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Combining the PPM with the SCT is supported in the literature as they both rely on learned behavior. Moving forward, the presentation was completed and participation sought.
