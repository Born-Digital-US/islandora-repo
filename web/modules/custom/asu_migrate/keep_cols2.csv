In light of those pressing issues, we, a group of ASU humanities faculty
and community partners, have embarked on a project to envision and design
what the Phoenix area food system ought to be in 2040. “Dinner 2040” is the
project culminating in an event over a meal where researchers and community
members will in have a layered conversation about what the food system in
Phoenix in 2040 ought to be and how we get there. If we want to ensure a
sustainable food system in Phoenix, one that respects Historical,
Cultural, and Place-based Practices, supports Sustaining Ecological
Health, encourages Culinary Innovations for Human Health, ensures Food
Justice, Social Justice, and Food Sovereignty—we are asking what should we
be doing now to get to that future.",,1,1,1,2015-08-12 23:16:29.309500+00:00
