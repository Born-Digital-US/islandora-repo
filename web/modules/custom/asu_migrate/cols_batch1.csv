Journal of Surrealism and the Americas (JSA),,http://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.C.159,Collection,,"The Journal of Surrealism and the Americas focuses on the subject of modern European and American intellectuals’ obsession with the “New World.” This obsession—the very heart of Surrealism—extended not only to North American sites, but also to Latin America, the Caribbean, and to the numerous indigenous cultures located there. The journal invites essays that examine aspects of the actual and fantasized travel of these European and American intellectuals throughout the Americas, and their creative response to indigenous art and culture, including their anthropological and collecting activities, and their interpretations of the various geographic, political, and cultural landscapes of the Americas. We furthermore intend to investigate the interventions / negotiations / repudiations of European/American or other Surrealisms, by indigenous as well as other artists, writers and filmmakers.

Materialized Views over Heterogeneous Structured Data Sources in a Distributed Event Stream Processing Environment (NSF CSR-0915325),,http://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.C.201,Collection,,"Software systems are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the coordination of heterogeneous structured data sources in a loosely-coupled distributed environment with support for handling events and streaming data. Some sample systems include homeland security, criminal justice, supply chain management, health care, and consumer monitoring systems to support marketing, personalization, and fraud detection. Such software systems involve query expressions over the data for detecting events, monitoring conditions, handling streams, and querying data. 

This research analyzes the dependencies among these filtering query expressions over structured data sources defined in different language components over relational or data-centric XML to detect common subexpressions as candidates for materialized views. When views are materialized, the results of the computed view are stored so that subsequent access to the view can efficiently retrieve information to avoid the cost of recomputing the entire view on subsequent references. This performance improvement is even more critical with distributed data sources. However, the materialized view must be updated if any data source that it depends on has changed. 

To avoid the recomputation of the entire view, an incremental view maintenance algorithm uses the change to incrementally compute updates to the materialized view. Using state-of-the-art commercial and open-source components, a prototype environment that supports a distributed event stream processing environment provides a research and evaluation platform to explore the identification, specification, and incremental evaluation of materialized views over heterogeneous, distributed structured data sources.

The editors are committed to publishing research-based articles and case studies of interest to scholars, artists, and students in the areas of entrepreneurship theory as applied to the arts; arts entrepreneurship education; arts management; arts and creative industries; public policy and the arts; the arts in community and economic development; nonprofit leadership; social entrepreneurship in or using the arts; evaluation and assessment; public practice in the arts.

Artivate is published twice yearly, summer and winter, in an online format.  The editors  are particularly interested in articles that actively link theory with practice in ways that will be of interest and impact to the broad cross-section of the Journal’s readership. Self-reflective studies from arts entrepreneurs and empirical research from scholars are equally welcome. We are interested in supporting the growth of our nascent discipline and also welcome debut articles from emerging scholars.

Our editorial board is drawn from diverse disciplines at the nexus of entrepreneurship and the arts.  These distinguished colleagues review and recommend articles submitted for consideration and we thank them in advance for their hard work and dedication.

Presented alongside the artworks they inspire, the audio recordings spur much-needed conversations around pregnancy and birth and create meaningful dialogues between storytelling and visual art.

Free and open to all, the conference delivered a two-day program of map-based story-telling, transdisciplinary analysis, state-of-the-art geospatial and cartographic demonstrations, engaging hands-on activities, and open community dialogue.

Inspiration and justification for convening such a conference was the confluence of two milestones in Grand Canyon history: (1) the centennial (1919-2019) of the legislation that led to Grand Canyon National Park, and (2) the sesquicentennial (1869-2019) of John Wesley Powell's famous first exploration and mapping survey through the canyons carved by the Colorado River, including the Grand Canyon.
