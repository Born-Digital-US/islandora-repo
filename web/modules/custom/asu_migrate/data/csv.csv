5603,"A|EDITED culturally competent behavioral weight loss program for adult Latinos with a BMI &gt;30kg/m2|","<p>This study answers the question, “In Adult Hispanic BMI ≥ 30 (P), how does development of a weight loss program that utilizes Motivational Interviewing (I) compared to counseling and educational materials only (C) affect weight loss over the period of three months (T).” There are limited published systematic reviews and randomized control trials to evaluate the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI), in conjunction with diet and exercise to promote weight loss. Participants (n = 5) were Latino patients of a local community health care center who were overweight and medically at risk due to unhealthy lifestyles that were determined through a screening test. The 4-week clinical pathway program used motivational interviewing in one-on-one sessions every other week, and implemented the “Your Heart, Your Life” curriculum the other weeks.  One expected outcome included lower anthropometric measurement numbers of participants’ WL, BMI, WC, and BP. Another expected outcome was an increase in physical activity. Participants were also expected to earn a higher score on a post-test about nutrition and healthy living. A paired t-test and power analyses were used to assess its effectiveness. Results indicated significant decrease in weight loss (t [5] = 3.68, p = .0211, Cohen’s dz=1.647). For heart healthy habits, there were significant increases all three categories: weight management (t [5] = - 3.36, p = .0211), cholesterol and fat (t [5] = - 3.138, p =.035, salt and sodium (t [5] = - 4.899, p = .008). In addition, there was an increase in knowledge (t [5] = - 4.000, p = .016).  Every participant showed small gains.

5604,"A|Depression Care Management Intervention for Home Health Nurses|","<p>EDITED Purpose: To examine the implementation of a web-based depression care management training program to increase home health nurses’ knowledge and attitudes regarding depression.</p>
<p>Background and Significance: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2015 that the incidence of major depression in elderly receiving home health service rose to 13.5% compared to less than 5% with those not receiving care in the community.</p>
<p>Materials and Methods: An intervention program was offered to a convenience sample of home health nurses caring for elderly in the community. The Depression CARE for Patients AT Home (depression CAREPATH), which is an evidenced-based online training program consisting of didactic resources about depression screening and depression care management and e-learning modules. Participants were given a pre and post survey to assess their knowledge of the material. Additionally demographic information was obtained via self-report.</p>
<p>Results: A total of 8 out of 18 home health nurses participated in the study. All were females; 13% Caucasian and 88% were Asian. There’s an average of 37 years old (SD 14.7, range 23-58) and had 3 years of experience (SD 2.07, range &lt;1-6). The mean depression CAREPATH knowledge total pre-test score was 15 (SD 1.85, range 13-18), while the mean total post-test score was 18.13 (SD 0.99, range 17-19). There was a difference in the depression knowledge test scores at baseline. All the participants obtained a passing score for the post-test (80%). The mean R-DAQ total pre-test score was 71 (SD 13.37, range 53-71) and mean total post-test score was 68, (SD 3.48, range 62-70). The professional confidence in depression attitude indicated agreement post intervention, except with the feeling comfortable in working with physical illness<br />than mental illness (pre intervention 62.5%, post intervention 100%). Participants agreed that home health nurses are well placed and more confident in assisting patients with depression (pre Depression Care Management 3 3 intervention 75%, post intervention 100%). In addition, participants felt more confident in<br />assessing suicide risk post intervention in patient s presenting with depression. Based from Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test, there was a statistical difference, z = -2.536, p= .01, between the depression knowledge pre and post-test scores, which indicates that there is an increase in depression knowledge after the intervention. However, there was no significant difference, z = -.846, p = .397 between the depression attitude, which indicate that there is no change in depression attitude after the intervention.</p>

5605,"A|Quality Improvement Project Implementing PrEP Academic Detailing to Impact Provider Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior in a Primary Care Setting|","<p>Background: In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug emtricitabine/tenofovir for use as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) after proving to be safe and effective at preventing HIV in multiple peer-reviewed studies. Despite the proven safety and value of PrEP treatment, use remains low in practice. Research has shown that low clinical use corresponds to low levels of understanding of PrEP among providers. Academic detailing is a method of innovation diffusion through provider education that results in changes in knowledge and practice. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of academic detailing on primary care provider knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to prescribe PrEP.</p>
<p>Methods: An academic detailing session was provided by the Florida Department of Health in Broward County to primary care providers (PCPs) at a private clinic in the Southeastern US. The Conceptual Model of Nursing and Population Health (CMNPH) and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services Framework (PARIHS) were used as guides for project design and evidence-based practice implementation. There were five participants in the academic detailing session including: a physician, a physician assistant (PA), and three medical students. PCP PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured using pre and post intervention surveys. PrEP prescription, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) screening, and HIV testing were measured using aggregate data queries for the time periods of four and eight weeks before and four and eight weeks after the educational intervention. No personal identifying information was obtained.</p>
<p>Results: Pre and post surveys were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank testing to examine differences between matched pairs of ordinal data. Significant PrEP screening and HIV/STI testing were analyzed pre and post intervention using paired t tests to compare pre and post intervention practices. Significant differences were found in the results (Z = 2.03, 1.84, and 1.83 respectively, p &gt; 0.1) The academic detailing intervention significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers and medical students regarding PrEP. The mean of active qualifying ICD 10 codes prior to the intervention versus post intervention were 5 (sd = 5.64) vs. 4.2 (sd = 4.87) respectively. No significant difference was found between active ICD 10 codes for patient visits before compared to after the intervention (t (9) = 1.12, p&gt;.1).</p>
<p>Conclusions: This project found that academic detailing improved provider self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding PrEP. However, self-reported survey scores were not correlated with changes in clinical practice based on ICD 10 codes. Additional clinical implications may include fostering clinical outreach and cooperation between the county health department and local primary care clinics. Further research is needed on the effects of PrEP academic detailing on clinical practice.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5606,"A|Walking Plan for Pregnant Women with Gestational Diabetes|A Feasibility Study","<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a well-established predictor for the development of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life. The incidence of GDM has been on the rise over the past 30 years and is the leading co-morbidity during pregnancy (Ferrara, 2007). Physical activity (PA) in combination with nutritional therapy has been shown to achieve glycemic control in women with GDM and is therefore first line therapy for management (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology [ACOG], 2017; Center for Disease Control and Prevent [CDC], 2018). Recommendations for PA in pregnancy include 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise most days of the week (ACOG 2015; U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2018).  Because of this, an innovative project was created to determine the feasibility of adding a walking plan into GDM care. Participants in the project received verbal and written instruction on an unsupervised structured walking plan set up for a beginner to gradually increase PA to the recommended time of 150 minutes per week for a total of four weeks. Eight women were interested, recruited, and enrolled in the project. Results show that overall, participant PA increased. One hundred percent agreed that the walking plan was useful and increased their awareness about PA. The addition of a walking plan in GDM teaching is an effective strategy to lower serum blood glucose (SBG) levels and for meeting PA recommendations during pregnancy.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5607,"A|Water Safety Education Program for Primary Care Providers|","<p>Purpose/Aims: We aim to increase understanding of water safety measures among primary care providers and improve the quality and efficiency of parent water-safety education. </p>
<p>Background and Significance: Drownings are the leading cause of death in one to four year old children in the United States. Arizona’s drowning rate is nearly double the national average for this age group. Water safety is an important anticipatory guidance topic a primary care provider should be discussing at all well visits.  The Health Belief Model is an effective framework to guide family education interventions. It is strongly encouraged that providers incorporate water safety education into the developmental milestone discussions. </p>
<p>Methods: Ten providers recruited from six Arizona pediatric primary care clinics participated in an educational one-hour session. Providers were encouraged to prioritize water safety discussions within the one to four year old age group and deliver education in the context of individual child development. Additionally, providers were updated on water safety recommendations from the Center for Family Health and Safety at Phoenix Children’s Hospital. Supplemental handouts with developmental water safety information were given to each office to aid providers in parent education. A pre-survey was administered to the providers prior to the education session and a post-survey was given at an eight-week follow up. The surveys measured provider perception and current practices of water safety education and utilized a Likert scale to compare data sets. Current and retrospective chart reviews were conducted to evaluate sustainability of the educational intervention.</p>
<p>Outcomes/Results: Sixty percent of provider participants were Medical Doctors (MD) and 40% were Nurse Practitioners (NP) with experience ranging from one year to over 20 years. Following the education session, providers were more likely to discuss keeping a child at arms-reach at all times (p=0.046) during their well visits. There was also an increase in providers incorporating water safety discussions into milestone education (p=0.054).</p>
<p>Conclusion: This educational intervention empowered providers to deliver water safety education in the context of normal developmental milestones at each one to four year old well visit. The anticipatory guidance emphasizes to parents that the behaviors their children exhibit are healthy and normal, but also explains how achieving these milestones put their children at greater risk for drownings. This quality improvement project is part of a larger initiative to decrease the number of drownings in Arizona through education and policy</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Evidence suggests a family centered methodology focusing on culture can positively improve weight loss, client satisfaction and participation. This project will evaluate use of culturally tailored resources for primary care providers to educate Hispanics on weight loss. Eight providers in a small practice in the Southwestern US were recruited to complete a pre- and postEBPAS tool after an educational session. A BMI form tracked provider use of the fotonovela<br />intervention against preferred methods. Feedback on time spent educating and overall perception were collected. Four providers completed the pre-EBPAS, three completed the post-, one participated in the intervention, and six contributed project feedback. Descriptive statistics revealed an aggregate provider decrease of five-points post-educational session for attitude toward adopting EBP. The BMI documentation form demonstrated a 53% (n = 8) use of the fotonovela. However, there were five undocumented fotonovelas taken/given out postintervention. Key themes noted by providers included poor timing of the project, satisfaction with workflow and resources, and overall discontent for the fotonovela.

5609,"|Adolescent Aggression and Restrictive Interventions|","<p>Seclusion and restraint are restrictive interventions that continue to be used in both physical care and mental health care settings as a means of controlling dangerous behavior such as aggression. Restrictive interventions place patients and healthcare staff in hostile situations that can lead to physical, mental, and emotional injuries that can last a lifetime. Unfortunately, restrictive interventions continue to be used in many healthcare organizations around the world and the<br />number of patient and staff injuries continue to rise. Stakeholders at a Phoenix area psychiatric inpatient hospital conducted an internal audit on the number of seclusion and restraint episodes in 2019, which revealed an increase in the number of seclusion and restraints episodes on the adolescent unit. The result of this audit led to the project question: For nurses on an acute adolescent inpatient unit, is a seclusion and restraint education program more effective than usual<br />practice in changing the knowledge and attitude regarding seclusion and restraint? The purpose of this practice change project was to provide staff education that focused on trauma informed care, de-escalation techniques, and therapeutic communication to improve staff confidence to ultimately lead to the reduction of seclusion and restraint use on an adolescent inpatient unit. A<br />pre and posttest questionnaire designed to better understand nurse attitude and knowledge regarding restrictive interventions prior to the education session was provided. A convenience sample of nurses (N=9) participated in the project. The findings from the pre and posttest questionnaire suggest that seclusion and restraint education for nurses may improve nurse knowledge and attitude regarding the use of restrictive interventions and reduce rates of use.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5610,"|Adolescent Depression|Integrating Behavioral Healthcare in a Pediatric Primary Care Setting","<p>INTRODUCTION: Despite depression affecting one of every ten adolescents, primary care providers struggle to detect depression in affected individuals. Unmanaged early onset adolescent mood disorders have an increased potential to result in suicide, the second leading cause of death in adolescents. Referring all patients with a positive depression screen to a mental health specialist creates treatment delay and burdens already limited community resources.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this primary care practice transformation was to improve pediatric primary care provider confidence and behavior to support and deliver evidence-based behavioral healthcare for adolescents with mild to moderate depression.</p>
<p>METHODS: An evidence-based adolescent depression education program was delivered to pediatric primary care providers in a small community setting. The program’s components included measures to identify and manage mild to moderate depression. Outcome measures included: 1) provider knowledge, beliefs, and confidence measured pre- and post-intervention; and 2) electronic health record documentation of provider adherence to guideline recommendations one, two, and three months post-intervention.</p>
<p>RESULTS: Four providers participated in the intervention. The mean total score for the provider beliefs and knowledge from a 5-point Likert scale demonstrated a positive increase after the intervention (14.75 vs. 23.25, p = .068). The mean total provider confidence score achieved near significance as well (12.25 vs. 21.75, p = .066). Resultant behavior change in the providers did not reach statistical significance when the electronic health records of all adolescent well visits over a three-month period were assessed. Screening for depression at adolescent well visits<br />ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION 3<br />increased from 0% to 84-90% post-intervention.

5613,"|Advance Care Planning in a Primary Care Setting|","<p>Purpose: Advance care planning (ACP) allows an individual to discuss and document their personal preferences at end-of-life. ACP has been shown to improve communication and reduce discomfort for patients and their families. The literature supports utilizing formalized, multimodality training programs for healthcare providers in order to increase their confidence in initiating ACP discussions. These findings led to the initiation of an evidence-based practice project in a primary care setting with the purpose of increasing advance care planning discussions between providers and patients with the use of a standardized education tool. </p>
<p>Background and Significance: National regulations mandate that patients are provided information about advance directives in the healthcare setting, but completion rates are not monitored and continue to be low. ACP is now a billable service for healthcare providers, but it has not provided enough incentive to increase completion rates. Barriers for healthcare providers in the outpatient setting include lack of time, protocols, and lack of education on how to initiate and foster advance care planning discussions. </p>
<p>Methods: Healthcare providers in a primary care office attended a 15-minute structured educational session with and a toolkit was provided on the importance of ACP, how to initiate conversations with patients, and bill for the service. Participants completed a portion of the Knowledge, Attitudinal, and Experiential Survey on Advance Directives (KAESAD) survey assessing their confidence in ACP before and three months post intervention. Participant confidence (N = 6) in ACP was analyzed using the Wilcoxin test and descriptive statistics. The number of billed ACP services for the office was collected for four months post intervention and compared to the previous four months. Outcomes: A significant increase in provider confidence after participating in a multimodality education program was found in the results (Z = -2.21, p = .03). There was a 42.1% increase in the number of billed ACP discussions for the office in the four months post intervention. </p>
<p>Conclusion: The future desired state is that ACP discussions become standard practice in primary care leading to the completion of advance directives. This can be accomplished through formalized education sessions and resources for providers in order to increase their confidence in initiating ACP discussions with patients. The ultimate goal is to decrease unnecessary spending at end-of-life while improving patient and family satisfaction with the quality of care received at end-of-life.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5614,"|Advance Care Planning|Providing Direction for Patients and Providers","<p>Many older Americans don’t have an advance directive (AD).  ADs are legal documents that allow a person to express what types of medical treatment or cares that they want at the end of their life if they were unable to speak for themselves.  Patients without an AD could receive unwanted treatment.  Providers can utilize advance care planning (ACP) to educate patients and support them in forming a medical power of attorney (MPOA) and AD.  Evidence suggests that having ACP conversations can engage a patient to form an AD.

5615,"|Advance Directive Advocacy|Empowering Homeless Clients to Express Their End-of-Life Wishes","<p>As Baby Boomers age, the number of older homeless patients facing end of life is increasing. Homeless individuals die of the same diseases as their domiciled counterparts, but they have distinct barriers to equitable end-of-life care, such as lack of regular medical care, a higher likelihood of comorbid serious mental illness and substance abuse, alienation from potential healthcare proxies, and specific fears related to dying.  Completion of an advance directive (AD) would address many of these barriers, as well as national goals of reducing medical costs associated with end of life care. A review of the literature indicates that homeless individuals, once educated on the purpose and significance of ADs, complete them at a higher rate than non-homeless people. Further, racial and ethnic disparities in document completion are minimized with educational interventions about an AD’s purpose. King’s Theory of Goal Attainment provides the theoretical basis for the application of such an intervention in the setting of a medical respite center and a day resource center that both serve the homeless. Thirty-seven clients of the two sites and 14 staff members were administered a pre-and post-test measuring attitudes and knowledge relating to ADs on a Likert scale, resulting in an increase in knowledge about one of the two documents that traditionally comprise an AD, while not significantly affecting attitudes.  Implications for practice include an inexpensive intervention that does not require a medically trained individual to deliver, enabling a broad application to a variety of settings with the goal of empowering a traditionally disenfranchised population to make health decisions related to the most vulnerable of life passages.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5616,"|Advance Directives in Long-Term Care|Implementation of Five Wishes","<p>Background and Purpose The lack of an advance directive (AD) can predispose a person to an aggressive course of treatment despite their wishes. When AD’s are incomplete, the chances of unwanted procedures, such as tube feedings and repeated transitioning between nursing homes and hospitals often result in the risk of increased mortality and morbidity, especially for older adults. Making end-of-life decisions can improve the quality of death by allowing individuals to make decisions to die in a dignified manner. The purpose of this project was to improve AD completion rates by implementing “Five Wishes” (FW) into the admission process in a long-term care facility (LTCF).</p>
<p>Methods The project took place on the skilled nursing units at a LTCF in Southwestern Arizona over a 2-month period of time. Twenty random charts were assessed before the start of the project to determine the residents AD status. Those 20 were then informed about FW’s and encouraged to complete one, along with all newly admitted residents to the skilled nursing units. Logs were used for data collection and each participating resident signed a HIPPA document. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and outcome variables.<br />Outcomes Of the 20 current residents included in the quantitative chart assessment, 6 (30%) residents completed a FW’s document. Fifty residents were admitted during the project span and 21 (42%) of them completed FW’s.</p>
<p>Conclusions The FW’s completion rates were lower than expected. None of the residents had an AD more detailed than a basic full code or do not resuscitate (DNR) status before being informed of FW’s. It is recommended that the facility social workers would have implemented the intervention to increase the likelihood of adherence.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5617,"|Advance Practice Nursing in the Pre-Hospital Setting|","<p>Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is expected to increase at a rate of 1.9% yearly, leading to the inability to provide efficient and timely care, causing preventable medical errors and delays in time sensitive care. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that 21-33% of all ED visits are non-emergent and increased age correlates with increased use of Pre-hospital EMS systems and emergency rooms. This study aimed to determine if an advance practice nurse (APN) in an older adult pre-hospital setting could reduce the use of 911 for non-urgent calls and transports, using the para-medicine model of care. Available evidence demonstrated a decrease in non-urgent transports with potential for significant savings to the healthcare system. This study was conducted in a community where 86.3% of residents are over the age of 65. The local fire department employed a full time APN who evaluated patients identified by EMS crews as at risk for repeat use of the 911 system. Following a 911 call and a referral by medics, the APN contacted patients to arrange a home visit. The purpose served to evaluate current health status, risks, and gaps in care. Interventions included assistance reducing safety concerns, assistance with coordination of care, and working with patient primary care providers to meet patient needs. Data collection included patient age, gender, number of 911 calls 30 days prior and 30 days post intervention, number of ambulance transports following intervention and PEI score after the initial APN visit. Six patients (32%) accepted the intervention and 13 or (68%) refused the intervention, with a mean age of 86 years of age. Wilcoxin signed rank test indicates the number of pre-intervention 911 calls was statistically significantly higher than the number of post-intervention 911 calls. Z= -2.23, Asymp. Sig. (2 tailed) = 0.03. A Fisher’s exact test and Pearson’s Chai squared test did not demonstrate a statistical significance in the number of ambulance transports, which could be attributed to the low participation rate in the intervention (n=6). These results indicate that an APN in the pre-hospital setting can have an impact on use of 911 calls for non-urgent problems and. Furthermore, the ability to assist with care coordination and advocate for available services within the circle of the medical home closes gaps in care that are currently left unfilled.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5618,"|Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Led Transitional Care Program in an Accountable Care Organization|","<p>Purpose: Reduce or prevent readmissions among heart failure (HF) patients and increase quality of life (QOL), self-care behavior (SCB) and satisfaction through an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) led transitional care program (TCP) in collaboration with an Accountable Care Organization (ACO).</p>
<p>Background: Hospital readmissions place a heavy financial burden on patients, families, and health care systems. Readmissions can be reduced or prevented by providing a safe transition through care coordination and enhanced communication. Research demonstrates implementation of APRN led home visits (HV) along with telephonic follow-up are cost effective and can be utilized for reducing readmissions among HF patients.</p>
<p>Methods: A program was designed with an ACO and carried out in a family practice clinic with a group of seven HF patients older than 50 years who were at risk of readmission. Interventions included weekly HV with supplemental telephonic calls by the APRN student along with a physician assistant for 12 weeks. Readmission data was collected. QOL and SCB were measured using “Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire” (MLHFQ) and “European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale” respectively. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Friedman Test.</p>
<p>Outcomes: There were no hospital readmissions at 30 days and the interventions demonstrated a positive effect on QOL, self-care management and satisfaction (χ2 = 30.35, p=.000). The intervention had a large effect on the outcome variables resulting in an increase in QOL and SCB scores post-intervention (ES= -1.4 and -2 respectively).</p>
<p>Conclusions: TCP designed with an ACO, carried out in a primary care setting has a positive effect on reducing hospital readmissions and improving QOL, SCBs, and patient satisfaction among HF patients. TCPs are not revenue generating at outset due to reimbursement issues, however future considerations of a multidisciplinary team approach with convenient workflow may be explored for long-term feasibility and sustainability.</p>

5620,"An|Education for Mental Health Care Providers|Sex Trafficking Victim Identification","<p>Purpose: The purpose of this project was to examine if a relationship existed between the changes in attitude and knowledge of a mental health care provider, before and after an educational intervention was given on how to identify sex trafficking victims.</p>
<p>Background:<br />According to the National Trafficking Hotline (2017), last year there were over 5,000 cases of sex trafficking reported. Lederer &amp; Wetzel (2014) discuss that more than 88% of victims interact with a health care provider while being trafficked at least once. A majority of cases, mental health care providers were informed that their patient was a sex trafficking victim through collaboration of other services. Without this collaboration, many providers would have never<br />known that they had interacted with a victim (Domoney, Howard, Abas, Broadben, &amp; Oram, 2015).</p>
<p>Methods:<br />The participant population consisted of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and psychologists working in acute and out patient settings.<br />A pre survey was given to identify the participant’s knowledge of sex trafficking and their awareness of available resources and tools to help screen as well as treat victims of sex trafficking. After completion, the participants viewed an educational voice over presentation that educated them on how to identify current sex trafficking victims, what screening tools are available, the mental health risk factors and how to protect both the victim and provider from potential danger from the alleged trafficker. A post survey was then given to assess their knowledge after the presentation intervention, how much they retained and their confidence in being able to assess and treat sex trafficking victims. All surveys and the presentation were available online for participant convenience via a private link.</p>
<p>Results:<br />The knowledge posttest score was higher than the pretest (Z=-2.694, p&lt;0.007).<br />The confidence score on treating sex trafficking victims was higher posttest (Z=-2.251, p&lt;0.024) No significant change in attitudes for advocating for sex trafficking victim care. All providers agreed that this high-risk vulnerable population needs advocates (Z=4.67, p&lt;0.707).</p>
<p>Conclusion:<br />All providers agreed for the need to advocate for victim care prior to the educational intervention. The results suggest that mental health providers are more knowledgeable posttest about risk factors, have a higher level of confidence in treating sex trafficking victims and have a higher confidence in their ability to protect victims and provide adequate care.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5621,"An|Innovative Literacy-Supportive Education Pilot for Wound Self-Care|","<p>As the incidence of acute and chronic wound conditions rises and wound dressing protocols become more complex, uninsured patients lacking access to specialty wound care are challenged to manage their own wounds. Understanding multistep dressing change protocols may be inhibited by low health literacy. Low health literacy is associated with reduced disease knowledge and self-care. Little evidence of health literacy effects on wound patients is available nor are literacy-sensitive educational interventions that address wound knowledge and self-care. Improved outcomes occur in all health literacy levels in other diseases with the use of literacy-sensitive educational interventions that incorporate more than one literacy strategy over multiple sessions. To examine the effectiveness of a literacy-sensitive wound education intervention on wound knowledge and self-care, an evidence-based pilot project was conducted in an urban wound clinic. A convenience sample of 21 patients received a literacy-sensitive wound education intervention consisting of spoken and written communication over several sessions. Instruments measured health literacy level, wound knowledge, dressing performance, and wound healing status. There was a significant increase in wound knowledge scores in all literacy groups from baseline to visit two (p &lt; .01) and four (p &lt; .01). Dressing performance scores remained consistently high through visit four in all literacy levels. All participant’s wounds progressed toward wound healing significantly from baseline to visit two (p &lt; .01) and four (p &lt; .01). Incorporation of a literacy-sensitive education intervention with supportive literacy aids over several sessions supports improved wound knowledge and dressing self-care and can affect healing in patients of all health literacy levels.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5622,"An|on-site Mindfulness-Based Intervention to Promote Wellness in the Workplace|","<p>The purpose of this project is to implement an on-site mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress and burnout among mental health care workers. Healthcare professionals are among the most stressed of any profession, and mental health workers are at an extremely high risk for burnout and compassion fatigue (Christopher &amp; Meris, 2010) with an estimated 21% to 67% of mental health workers reporting that they experience high levels of burnout (Salyers et al., 2011). After researching the literature, it was evident that practicing mindfulness can lead to less stress and higher job satisfaction. In an effort to combat this problem, an on-site mindfulness intervention was implemented at an outpatient psychiatric setting for eight weeks. Twenty-seven mental health workers gave their consent to be part of the study, and eleven were able to complete the study and self-assessment surveys for three time periods. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (the Human Service Version) and a 1-item job satisfaction were used to measure the effect of intervention on employees’ levels of stress and job satisfaction. A non-parametric Friedman test of differences among repeated measures was conducted and findings were not significant when comparing the average total scores of means between pre-, post-, or 1-month follow-up for Emotional Exhaustion (p = .148), Depersonalization (p = .223), Personal Achievement (p = .784) and job satisfaction (p = .422).

5623,"|Approaching Depression Related to Chronic Musculoskeletal Disorders with Interprofessional Collaboration|","<p>Background and Significance:  In patients with chronic joint pain, the therapeutic intervention of physical activity has been reported to be highly effective, yet underutilized.  Depression is a common reason for this underutilization and may coexist in up to 48% of patients.  By increasing screening for coexistent depression in patients with chronic joint pain using interprofessional collaboration (IPC), depression can be detected.  If managed appropriately patients may interrupt the pain-depression cycle, increase utilization of physical activity and thereby improve outcomes for chronic joint pain sufferers.</p>
<p>Purpose/Aims:  The purpose of this project was to increase the rate of depression screening for patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders in the physical therapy setting.</p>
<p>Methods: The institutional review board at Arizona State University approved this study with exempt status.  </p>
<p>Depression screening with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was completed by adult clients in three outpatient physical therapy clinics in the Midwest and Southwest United States (n=165).  Degree of depression and patient response rates were measured and analyzed using descriptive statistics.  </p>
<p>Staff were surveyed prior to and post project completion regarding their viewpoints on IPC and depression in this patient population.   Staff demographics were analyzed and they were evaluated on their change in perception of the problem and their likelihood of sustainability with a Wilcoxin Signed Ranks Test.  </p>
<p>Outcomes: Patient response rate was 91.5% (n=165) exposing a mean PHQ-9 score of 5.01 (mild depression).  More notably, patients whom had an existing diagnosis of depression had a mean PHQ-9 score 10.47 (moderate depression) indicating poorly controlled symptoms. </p>
<p>After an educational session to increase knowledge, staff perception of the problem did not significantly change, with a mean score of 2.25 out of 5 predicting “somewhat” likelihood of project sustainability. </p>

5626,"|Caring for the Caregiver|","<p>Background: As the nation’s population ages and the prevalence of chronic diseases, like dementia, increases, informal caregivers will play an increasingly important role in maintaining independence for the elderly. Informal caregivers provide most long-term care for the elderly in this country and save hundreds of billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. However, most informal caregivers experience burden secondary to caregiving that adversely impacts their physical, social, and/or psychological health. Caregiver burden threatens caregiver health and contributes to institutionalization of care recipients. Since the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) model of care delivery relies heavily on informal caregivers to maintain independent aging, understanding and meeting the needs of caregivers is essential to the sustainability and success of PACE programs. </p>
<p>Purpose: This evidence-based practice (EBP) project was a gap analysis that surveyed 156 caregivers at an urban PACE program in the Midwest to examine caregiver demographics, caregiver burden, caregiver interest in support services, and the relationship between these variables to guide the development of caregiver programs. </p>
<p>Methods: Caregiver Assessments were administered to 156 caregivers via telephone or in person. The assessment included caregiver demographics, interest in caregiver services, and the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) to assess caregiver burden. The ZBI-12 has good reliability and validity as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 and a correlation with the full version ZBI scores of 0.95. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Pearson r correlation test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Mann-Whitney U test on SPSS version 25. This project was approved by the Arizona State University IRB.  </p>
<p>Results/Outcomes: Of 171 eligible informal caregivers of program participants living outside of an institution, 156 completed the survey, 3 refused, and 12 were unreachable. Most informal caregivers surveyed were Caucasian (69.5%) females (66%), children of the care recipients (45.5%), caring for people with dementia (40.6%), with some college education (37.2%), who earned $10,000-$25,000 annually (38.7%), provided over 30 hours of care per week (55.8%), and averaged 61.4 years old (SD=7.7). The average ZBI-12 score was 12.15 (SD=9.04), indicating a moderate level of burden. The most common stressors indicated by caregivers were activities of daily living (ADL) assistance (63.5%) and the time commitment involved in caregiving (57.7%). Correlates to high burden score included: limited time, aggressive behavior, financial stress, grief, assistance with ADLs, wandering behavior, toileting assistance/incontinence, and lack of sleep. Respite care was identified by 42.9% of those surveyed as the most helpful resource provided by PACE. 55.1% and 50.6% of caregivers indicated an interest in educational sessions and support groups respectively, if these services were offered in the future.  </p>
<p>Conclusion: Through the exploration of caregiver demographics, factors correlated to increased burden, and caregiver interest in support services, the results from this EBP project provide guidance to programs, particularly other PACE programs, seeking to proactively mitigate caregiver burden through support services. The results indicate that respite care, educational sessions, and support groups should be prioritized when developing informal caregiver support services.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

The evidence shows that integrating virtual visits into palliative care is an innovative way to reduce hospital readmissions, preserve costs, and reduce geographical barriers. The purpose of this article is to evaluate how well transitional care virtual visits reduce future hospital readmissions for palliative care patients when compared to usual care of in-home nurse visits. Palliative care patients from a large palliative company in Arizona, who received a transitional care, post hospital discharge, virtual visit with traditional model care (intervention) were compared to randomly selected traditional model care patients (control). Data was collected through a retrospective chart review at 30 and 60 days post hospital discharge to evaluate for hospital readmissions and avoided readmissions. The Fishers Exact test was used to compare the results of the two groups to each other. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Virtual visits have an added cost to the agency without decreasing the risk of readmission. Implications for practice are to continue offering transitional care in-home nurse visits.

5629,"|Cystic Fibrosis Education for School Personnel|","<p>Aim. The purpose of this project was to determine if educating elementary school personnel would improve their knowledge and self-efficacy in caring for students with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and improve the health and educational outcomes of students with this disease.<br />Background. Evidence suggests that teachers play a big role in the management of students with chronic illnesses. However, current literature indicates that teachers lack basic knowledge about childhood chronic illnesses and how to manage students with chronic illnesses. Synthesis of evidence indicated that an online CF educational intervention would improve knowledge and self-efficacy among school personnel, thereby improving the health and educational outcomes of students with CF.<br />Methods. Elementary school personnel in Southern Arizona were asked to do an online pre-survey to evaluate knowledge and self-efficacy, view a short presentation on cystic fibrosis, and complete a post-survey. Parents of students with CF were asked to track 504 plan use and CF related absences. Frequencies were used to evaluate participant demographic data and survey data. The McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Test were used to analyze survey data.<br />Results. Analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in perceived knowledge (p = .024) and self-efficacy scores (p = .034). Although survey scores showed an average score improvement between pre-survey and post-survey total scores (p = .212), it was not statistically significant.<br />Conclusion. Results showed an overall improvement in CF knowledge and self-efficacy among elementary school personnel. These results may provide an opportunity for CF healthcare providers and schools to promote the health and education of students with CF.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5630,"|Decreasing Stigma and Improving Therapeutic Interventions for Psychiatric Patients in the Emergency Department|","<p>Findings suggest that stigma associated with mental health may be as strong in healthcare providers as it is in the general public. Research involving non-behavioral health nurses, and medical and nursing students, sought to identify bias and negative attitudes directed towards psychiatric patients in a non-psychiatric setting. Studies were reviewed to determine the effects of educational interventions to teach empathy and increase knowledge related to the pathology of, and treatment modalities for, psychiatric patients. Several scales were used to measure bias and rate interventions to minimize it. Studies found that healthcare personnel, including nurses, are considered by mental health consumers to be primary contributors to stigma and discrimination against those with mental illness. The studies also discovered that participation in an educational intervention to learn empathy and acquire knowledge about psychiatric patients directly decreased bias. The project utilized the evidence-based practice PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PPM) supported by Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Combining the PPM with the SCT is supported in the literature as they both rely on learned behavior. Moving forward, the presentation was completed and participation sought. It was at this point the project shifted its perspective. Out of 80 nurses asked to attend 1 of the 2 presentations, a total of 3 nurses participated.

5631,"|Developing Team Skills and Attitudes through Interprofessional Leadership Competencies|","<p>The health care industry increasingly recognizes interprofessional collaboration (IPC) as the key to optimizing delivery of care, and interprofessional education (IPE) has been the foundational method for building IPC. When IPC is examined, leadership skills of the practitioners are often seen as a positive force for optimizing team performance. This project aimed to deliver an education session sharing interprofessional leadership (IPL) competencies and the effect they may have on attitudes toward IPC. A pilot was designed for a single site, a student run clinic in a large city in the Southwest United States, which serves as a learning laboratory to help future health practitioners grow IPC skills through effective and innovative IPE. A search of the available evidence supporting this project revealed that educational activities delivered to practitioners can build the leadership skills seen in effective IPC. During the Fall 2017 semester, the education sessions were delivered to student practitioners at the clinic during their semester-long rotation. The University of the West of England Interprofessional Questionnaire, designed to measure self-assessment of attitudes toward collaborative learning and collaborative working, was deployed at the beginning and end of a semester-long rotation to all students working at the clinic to look for changes. A low sample size limited results to assessment of clinical significance, but showed some changes that could be significant if the project continues. Clinically significant changes show an increase in students’ rating of their own skills and preferences toward interprofessional practice. In keeping with the learning laboratory model at the clinic, these outcomes support continued delivery and examination of the education model with subsequent clinic rotations to strengthen the conclusions being drawn from the results.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Included in this category are those patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Functional GI issues are an important public health concern as they are becoming increasingly more common; they can be disabling and can cause significant socioeconomic burden in regard to health care costs, productivity and disability. There is strong evidence that probiotics have the potential to reduce IBS symptoms. Unfortunately, probiotics are underutilized in the clinical setting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to increase knowledge and self-efficacy in patients with functional GI symptoms regarding the use of probiotics for symptom management. Patients in an outpatient GI practice in Southwestern United States with chronic functional GI symptoms were shown an educational video regarding the origins and benefits of using probiotics to manage chronic symptoms. Knowledge of probiotics, self-efficacy and willingness to utilize probiotics was measured by asking participants to complete a modified Health Belief Model survey before and after viewing the video. Patient demographics were collected. There were 75 participants (n=75) who participated in the project with a mean age of 40.3 years (SD=15.41), 85% female and 15% male. Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze changes in paired data with significant improvements in self-efficacy (Z=3.93, p&lt; .01), benefits of probiotic use (Z=4.33, p&lt;.01) and decreased barriers to probiotics use (Z=-4.31, p&lt;.01). After participants viewed the educational video, 95% of patients indicated they would try probiotics (CI 95%, p&lt;.01) versus 65% of patients who would try probiotics before viewing video.

Social support may improve health empowerment and lead to increased perception of well-being.</p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of social support provided by a cancer support agency on health empowerment and perceived well-being in adults impacted by cancer.</p>
<p>Conceptual Framework: The Health Empowerment Theory maintains that perceived wellbeing is the desired outcome; mediated by health empowerment through social support, personal growth, and purposeful participation in active goal attainment.</p>
<p>Methods: Twelve adults impacted by cancer agreed to complete online questionnaires at<br />baseline and at 12 weeks after beginning participation in social support programs provided by a cancer support agency. <br />Instruments included: Patient Empowerment Scale, The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), and The Office of National Statistics (ONS) Subjective Well-Being Questions.</p>
<p>Results: Four participants completed pre and post surveys. An increase was seen in<br />empowerment scores (pre M = 1.78, SD = 0.35 and post M = 3.05, SD = 0.42).

5637,"|Effective Utilization of HealthCare Resources|An Educational Intervention for Adult Patients","<p>Over the last ten years, a dramatic increase in Emergency Department (ED) visits has been prominent. Non-emergent chief complaints, such as repeat chronic care needs, are causing increased ED visits. The underutilization of primary care resources has been correlated with the overutilization of emergency care resources. ED overutilization is having a negative rippling effect on the ability of the US healthcare system to care for patients. Emergency department personnel and other resources are strained, leading to overcrowding and decreased quality of care. Health insurance and provider accessibility has been linked to the high rates of ED usage by adults age 18 – 64, with the highest rates seen in those under public health coverage, such as Medicaid, compared to those who were uninsured. To encourage primary care visits and discourage non-emergent ED usage, the United States health system includes patient education on the appropriate ED use, higher-copayment as financial disincentives, and encouragement of provider-patient relationships with Primary care providers (PCP). The public health clinics, including Federally Qualified Health Centers, provide patient education on the appropriate use of PCP versus ED resources, and offer extended office hours during evenings and weekends; trimming the rate of non-emergent ED visits can significantly reduce health care costs.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

<p>Background and Significance:  HF affects over 5.1 million people in the United States, costing $31 billion a year; $1.7 billion spent on Medicare readmissions within 30 days of discharge.  Guidelines and care coordination prevent expenses related to hospital readmissions and improve quality of life for adults with HF. </p>
<p>Methods:  Healthcare providers (HCPs) at a metropolitan hospital participated in an education session reviewing HF treatment and CMD.  Thirty participants completed the single five-point Likert scale pre/post surveys evaluating their opinions of knowledge and behaviors toward implementation of guidelines and CMD.  Patient outcome data was abstracted measuring pre/post education compliance for ejection fraction, ACE/ARB, beta-blocker, HF education, follow-up appointments, aldosterone antagonist, anticoagulation, hydralazine nitrate, and CMD 30-45 day’s pre/post education.  Analyses included descriptive statistics of participants and pre/post surveys using a paired t-test.  Percentage of compliance for quality measures was completed on patients from September through December. </p>
<p>Results:   Providers post intervention showed improved knowledge and behaviors toward implementation of guidelines and CMD, including reconciliation of medications to statistical significance.

5639,"|Equine Assisted Learning|An Evidence-Based Intervention for Families","<p>Background: It is estimated that 50% of all mental illness arises prior to age 14, an incident attributed in part to disruptions and imbalances within the family system. Equine assisted learning is a complementary and alternative approach to family therapy which is being used increasingly to promote mental health in both adults and children. This study sought to build and deliver an evidence-based, family-centered equine assisted learning program aimed at promoting family function, family satisfaction and child social-emotional competence, and to measure its acceptability and preliminary effect. </p>
<p>Method: Twenty families with children 10 years and older were recruited to participate in a 3-week equine assisted learning program at a therapeutic riding center in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions included groundwork activities with horses used to promote life skills using experiential learning theory. The study design included a mixed-method quasi-experimental one-group pretest posttest design using the following mental health instruments: Devereaux Student Strengths Assessment, Brief Family Assessment Measure (3 dimensions), and Family Satisfaction Scale to measure child social-emotional competence, family function, and family satisfaction, respectively. Acceptability was determined using a Likert-type questionnaire with open-ended questions to gain a qualitative thematic perspective of the experience. </p>
<p>Results: Preliminary pretest and posttest comparisons were statistically significant for improvements in family satisfaction (p = 0.001, M = -5.84, SD = 5.63), all three domains of family function (General Scale: p = 0.005, M = 6.84, SD = 9.20; Self-Rating Scale: p = 0.050, M = 6.53, SD = 12.89; and Dyadic Relationship Scale: p = 0.028, M = 3.47, SD = 7.18), and child social-emotional competence (p = 0.015, M = -4.05, SD 5.95). Effect sizes were moderate to large (d &gt; 0.5) for all but one instrument (Self-Rating Scale), suggesting a considerable magnitude of change over the three-week period. The intervention was highly accepted among both children and adults. Themes of proximity, self-discovery, and regard for others emerged during evaluation of qualitative findings. Longitudinal comparisons of baseline and 3-month follow-up remain in-progress, a topic available for future discussion.</p>
<p>Discussion: Results help to validate equine assisted learning as a valuable tool in the promotion of child social-emotional intelligence strengthened in part by the promotion of family function and family satisfaction. For mental health professionals, these results serve as a reminder of the alternatives that are available, as well as the importance of partnerships within the community. For therapeutic riding centers, these results help equine professionals validate their programs and gain a foothold within the scientific community. Additionally, they invite future riding centers to follow course in incorporating evidence into their programs and examining new directions for growth within the mental health community.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5640,"|Evaluating the Effect of a Heart Failure Cardiac Rehabilitation Intervention on Hospital Readmission Rates|","<p>Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common and costly conditions for hospital readmissions in the United States (Conway, 2015). Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are effective in decreasing hospital readmission rates (Koukoui, Desmoulin, Lairy, Bleinc, Boursiquot, Galinier, &amp; Koukoui, 2015). Medicare has established new requirements for qualification into a CR program; thus, patients are at risk for readmission in the six-weeks post discharge. To reduce HF hospital readmissions and to increase enrollment into the HF program, an infrastructure was implemented beginning in January 2016. This quality improvement project employed a patient chart audit reviewing overall hospital readmission rates for HF at a large hospital in Arizona. A comparison of readmission rates was made between the 6 months prior to, and the 6-months after the expanded utilization of the HF program. An independent-samples t test was calculated comparing the mean score of the readmission rates before and after a HF CR intervention. No significant difference was found (t(358) = .721, p &gt; .05). The mean of the group before the intervention (m =.15, sd = .36) was not significantly different from mean in the intervention group (m = .13, sd = .33). Implications for practice cannot completely be concluded from this project findings. Continued studies focusing on the enrollment, attendance, and completion of the HF CR program could assist in determining the benefits of referring all patients with the diagnosis of HF to the HF CR program.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

The goal of this project was to standardize the diagnostic process by adopting an evidence-based ADHD algorithm protocol for preschoolers (3-5 years). In an urban military pediatric clinic, five pediatric care clinicians were provided with an educational ADHD algorithm. Pre/posttest surveys were used to assess provider knowledge and perceptions of care. Chart audits determined preschooler ADHD diagnosis prevalence pre- and post-implementation of the algorithm. The rate of ADHD diagnosis in preschoolers reduced significantly from 78.6% pre-audit to 22.6% post-audit. In addition, providers improved their accuracy in diagnosing alternative disorders and behaviors that mimic the symptomology of ADHD (Z=-2.0, p=0.046).

Despite the known negative impact of these diseases, vaccination rates routinely fall short of national goals and recommendations.  Although vaccination decisions are complex, a recommendation from a health care provider is one of the key motivators for individuals receiving a vaccine.  Motivational interviewing (MI), a counseling approach primarily used to address substance abuse, can be applied to other health-related behaviors.</p>
<p>Local Problem: Despite previous quality improvement efforts aimed at increasing vaccine rates for influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV), and meningitis B (MenB), vaccinations at large university health centers have been well below benchmarks set by Healthy People 2020.</p>
<p>Methods: This study was guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and included MI training and regular reinforcement for health care providers to address vaccine hesitancy with college students.</p>
<p>Results: Influenza vaccination rates improved, but HPV vaccine rates remained stable and MenB vaccine rates decreased compared with the previous year.  Clinicians demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge of MI techniques after a targeted educational intervention.  Repeat measures indicate the potential for sustained improvement when ongoing reinforcement is provided.</p>
<p>Conclusion: MI can be an effective part of a strategy to increase vaccination rates.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5643,"|Health Literacy Education|For Parents of Children Preschool Aged and Younger","<p>Purpose: The purpose of health literacy education is to increase an individual’s understanding of health and use of the healthcare system. Low health literacy is associated with misuse of healthcare resources and misunderstanding of healthcare teaching. Education has demonstrated efficacy in improving health literacy. A personalized educational program was provided to parents of Head Start children, offered in Spanish and English, and at a 3rd to 5th education level.</p>
<p>Design: Using an established program for health literacy education, a Doctor of Nursing Practice project was implemented. The effect the program had on increasing the health literacy of participants over a period of 4 weeks was examined. The predominately, Latina participants received three hours of instruction based upon the health literacy book “What to do When Your Child Gets Sick”.</p>
<p>Setting and Subjects: The educational program took place in a large, urban county in the Southwestern United States with 24 parents of preschool age children in Head Start.</p>
<p>Intervention: The educational program contained three hours of classroom instruction utilizing PowerPoint® presentation, demonstration, and teach-back techniques on how to care for a child’s healthcare needs.</p>
<p>Measures and Analysis: Pre-, post- and telephone surveys were used to assess the impact of the health literacy educational program. Wilcoxon and Freidman tests were used to interpret the results.</p>
<p>Results: Despite no significant increases in health literacy post implementation, participants’ remarked that they felt the class was helpful and wanted to share the information with friends and family. They appreciated the program and wanted more educational opportunities.</p>

5644,"|Health Promotion Education for Overweight and Obesity in Adults with Endocrine Disorders|","<p>Purpose: The purpose of this project was to implement health promotion education for overweight and obese adults with endocrine disorders. The overarching goal was to change dietary intake and improve exercise to reduce the incidence, prevalence, and impact of comorbidities associated with obesity. Background/Synthesis: Obesity is a significant epidemic facing the nation today with multiple impacts on the national healthcare system. There is often an association between obesity and endocrine disorders such as type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Both obesity and diabetes cost the nation billions of dollars annually in healthcare costs. Evidence shows that lifestyle modifications related to nutrition and physical activity are effective in weight reduction and prevention of chronic disease, especially when given by a healthcare provider. Methods: Fifteen adult patients at an endocrinology office in Arizona received individual counseling using the teach-back method focusing on health promotion behaviors through nutrition and exercise with a two-week follow-up phone call. Short-term outcomes measured in this project included changes in dietary intake and exercise behaviors through a pre- and post-test adapted from an obesity-screening tool developed by Greenwood et al. (2008). Outcomes/Results: Participants were primarily Caucasian and Hispanic, married, female, average age of 50 years, average BMI of 34.5, and some college education. There was a statistically significant increase in health promoting behavior on posttest scores (M=66, SD=6.23, range=58-76) compared to pretest scores (M=61, SD=4.72, range=50-66), t(14)=-2.55, p=0.023. Conclusions and Implications: Overall, patient health promotion behaviors increased with this educational intervention. Clinical implications include a potential decrease in patient comorbidities related to overweight and obesity. Implications for the greater healthcare system include decreased comorbidities, utilization of healthcare resources, and costs associated with overweight and obesity. Future recommendations would include determining weight and BMI changes over a longer period of time for even better outcome measures.<br />	Keywords: obesity, obese, overweight, health promotion, health education, diet, exercise, nutrition</p>",,"Arizona State University.

<p>Background: Although prediabetes awareness has slightly improved, the nationwide unawareness remains high.  General knowledge about the disease and its risk factors and prevention are significant variables to adopt health-promoting behaviors.  Lifestyle change intervention has been shown to be effective with the risk reduction behaviors in prediabetic population.  However, it can be a daunting task to translate during short office visits.  </p>
<p>Methods: Sixteen participants with risk for prediabetes or diagnosed prediabetes enrolled into a 5-minute education session in a rural health clinic.  They received follow-up phone calls weekly for 4 weeks.  Demographics, PA, EH and SE levels were measured before the education session.  During the fourth week, PA, EH and SE were measured again.  Frequency, descriptive analysis, and paired t-test were used for data analysis.  </p>
<p>Outcomes: The mean age of participants was 56.6  13.0 years.  Approximately 81% were female, and 62.5% identified as Caucasian.  Over 80% reported married, and 56.3% described their health condition as good.  The three quarters (75%) noted they have heard of the term prediabetes. The intervention had a significant effect on PA, EH and SE from the baseline to post intervention, p = .005, p = .008, and p = .003, respectively.

5646,"|Impact of an Electronic Clinical Decision Support Tool on Early Maternal Glucose Screening in Pregnancy|","<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of<br />pregnancy that is not clearly overt diabetes, has become more common as the rates of obesity in women of childbearing age have increased. Undiagnosed, uncontrolled diabetes in pregnancy can lead to maternal and infant health comorbidities as well as have adverse long-term effects for mother or baby. Although routine screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs between 24 and 28 weeks gestation, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends screening earlier in pregnancy for women at risk for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Risk factors include previous history of GDM, known impaired glucose metabolism, or obesity (BMI &gt; 30). The purpose of this project is to implement the clinical practice guideline for early maternal glucose screening during pregnancy in women with risk factors through the integration of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool in an electronic health record (EHR). CDS tools can be utilized as a point of care strategy to remind providers of the clinical practice guidelines and to assist providers in decision-making related to screening. Participating providers (n=18) utilized the CDS tool during the initial obstetrical visit for at risk women without a prepregnancy diabetes diagnosis and entering prenatal care prior to 24 weeks. The impact of<br />implantation of the CDS tool shows that an increase in screening was statistically significant (p&lt;.001).</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5647,"|Impact of Nurse Navigation on Parkinson’s Disease Community Wellness|","<p>Background: There is a great need to provide people with Parkinson disease (PD) not only quality medical care, but social support and disease-related resources. Nurses have the training and interpersonal relationship skills to make a tremendous difference in the lives of people living with PD. Objective: This quality improvement project evaluated the effect of a nurse navigation program on self-efficacy among people living with PD. </p>
<p>Methods: Twenty-four members of a PD specific wellness center in the United States were recruited to participate in a nurse navigation program for a 12-week period. The intervention period included an initial needs assessment, ten individual 45-minute sessions focused on specific aspects of PD wellness, and a concluding visit. Results: There was a significant decline in quality of life based on average PDQ-39 scores for the participants in January 2019 (M =24.44, SD=16.66) compared to January 2018 (M=20.11, SD =12.78) where higher scores signify worse quality of life; t(23)-4.329 p=0.025. Average self-efficacy for managing chronic disease pre-intervention scores (M=6.58, SD=1.70) verses post-intervention scores (M=7.44, SD=1.48) showed a significant increase in self-efficacy with a medium effect size; t(23)-0.854 p=0.016, d=0.54. Additionally, unique satisfaction surveys showed high satisfaction with nurse navigation throughout the participant sample and wellness center staff members. </p>

5648,"|Implementation of a Child Physical Abuse Screening Program in the Emergency Department|","<p>Children often present to the emergency department (ED) for treatment of abuse-related injuries. ED healthcare providers (HCPs) do not consistently screen children for physical abuse, which may allow abuse to go undetected and increases the risk for re-injury and death. ED HCPs frequently cite lack of knowledge or confidence in screening for and detecting child physical abuse. The purpose of this evidence-based quality improvement project was to implement a comprehensive screening program that included ED HCP education on child physical abuse, a systematic screening protocol, and use of the validated Escape Instrument. After a 20-minute educational session, there was a significant increase in ED HCP knowledge and confidence scores for child physical abuse screening and recognition (p &lt; .001). There was no difference in diagnostic coding of child physical abuse by ED HCPs when evaluating a 30-day period before and after implementation of the screening protocol. In a follow-up survey, the Escape Instrument and educational session were the most reported screening facilitators, while transition to a new electronic health system was the most reported barrier. The results of this project support comprehensive ED screening programs as a method of improving HCP knowledge and confidence in screening for and recognizing child physical abuse. Future research should focus on the impact of screening on the diagnosis and treatment of child physical abuse. Efforts should also be made to standardize child abuse screening programs throughout all EDs, with the potential for spread to other settings.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5649,"|Implementation of a Culturally-Tailored Diabetes Education Program in a Medically-Underserved Community Health Clinic|","<p>Purpose: Hispanics diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) have poorer health outcomes than non-Hispanic whites. Approximately one- half of all Hispanic DM patients utilize community health clinics for their DM needs. Evidence suggests that using a culturally-tailored approach to DM education can uniquely improve health outcomes in this population. The purpose of this evidence-based practice (EBP) project was to improve glycemic control in a medically underserved Hispanic community through a culturally-tailored DM education program. </p>
<p>Methods: This quasi-experimental pre/post design project was guided by the ACE Star Model and Leininger’s Theory of Cultural Care. The affiliated University’s IRB approved this project. The Diabetes Empowerment Education Program (DEEP) was implemented in a free, community clinic in a medically underserved area. Spanish speaking patients (n = 15) with A1C levels <br />&gt; 8mg/dl were recruited to participate in a 6-week group educational program facilitated by community health workers. Outcomes included A1C levels, weight, and two surveys from the Michigan Diabetes Research Center - DM knowledge test and the DM empowerment scale. </p>
<p>Results: Paired sample t-tests were used to analyze the outcomes. The participants had an average pre-A1C of 8.82 mg/dl with post-A1C of 8.01 mg/dl (p = .028). Pre-knowledge test scores averaged 9.40 with post-test average of 12.07 (p &lt; .001). Empowerment scores increased from 4.09 to 4.63 (p = .001). The reduction between the average pre-and post-weight measures were not statistically significant (p = .681).</p>
<p>Discussion: The implementation of a culturally-tailored DM educational program in a medically underserved community had a significant impact on reducing A1C levels, improving DM knowledge, and enhancing empowerment levels. Although the sample size was small and limited to one clinic, applying these programs can have a measurable clinical impact in the treatment of Hispanic DM patients.

There are many known health complications associated with obesity including premature death.  Family-based obesity interventions that promote healthy lifestyle habits are effective at enabling children to make changes needed to avoid long-term health complications associated with obesity.  The purpose of this evidence-based practice intervention was to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-based obesity intervention on familial lifestyle behaviors related to nutrition, physical activity, and screen time.</p>
<p>Methods<br />Two overweight-obese children (according to CDC criteria) ages 8-12 years old visiting a pediatric primary care clinic in a suburban neighborhood located in the southwest region were recruited to participate in this evidence-based practice intervention based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Familial lifestyle behaviors were assessed using the Family Health Behavior Scale (FHBS) prior to receiving an educational intervention addressing nutritional, physical activity, and screen time recommendations and again after following these recommendation for 6-weeks.  Additionally, scheduled follow-up phone calls were made every 3 or 6-weeks addressing any parental questions that surfaced.  Data was insufficient for statistical analysis, however, anecdotal recommendations for future implementation of this intervention resulted.</p>
<p>Results<br />Of the two patients who participated, pre- and post-intervention data was only attainable from one patient.  That patient did have improved scores within each of the 4 FHBS subscales (parent behaviors, physical activity, mealtime routines, and child behaviors).  Overall, 11 of the 27 behaviors assessed improved, 12 behaviors resulted in no change, and 4 behaviors worsened.  Recommendations related to a more successful implementation of this intervention in the futurre include improved provider pariticpation (buy-in), utiliazation of broader inclusion criteria, consideration of the implementation time-frame, and application of the Health Belief Model for addressing existing barriers for each patient prior to implementing the intervention.</p>

5653,"|Implementing a safety plan and using Follow-up Postcards to Mitigate Suicide Risk in Patients in the Emergency Department|","<p>Suicide has become a national concern due to the increasing rates across the country. The 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention aims to improve the area of clinical prevention. Emergency departments (ED) play a key role in addressing this effort as they have multiple opportunities to connect with patients who are at risk. There exists a high-risk period of time immediately following a patient’s discharge from emergency care. To address this period of concern, a review of the literature was conducted on the effectiveness of follow-up contacts as a means to prevent suicide and suicide related attempts in this at-risk population. Based on this review, a follow-up intervention was proposed to increase patients’ social support and knowledge on suicide prevention through a safety plan and the use of caring postcards. The aim was to evaluate the degree to which implementation of a safety plan and follow-up using postcards reduces suicide risk in the ED. ED suicide prevention practices such as safety planning and caring contacts with postcards have shown to be feasible and cost-effective methods to reduce patients’ risk of suicide as they provide education and address the high-risk period of time after discharge. Using a quasi-experimental pre and post-test design, English speaking adults 18 years of age and older, admitted to an ED in the Phoenix Metropolitan area with suicidal ideation, were voluntarily recruited for two weeks. The self-rated Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) was used as a baseline assessment along with the introduction of a safety plan. Participants were then followed with the receipt of postcards with caring messages over a two-week period, and a final SBQ-R. The SBQ-R has shown beneficial reliability and validity measuring suicidality in the adult population. Data from the pre-SBQ-R was analyzed using descriptive statistics as no post-SBQ-Rs were received. Outcomes for this project included a reduction in suicidal ideation and suicide risk. This project provides insight into the implementation of a safety plan and follow-up intervention in the ED and their attempts to reduce acute suicide risk as well as highlight the value that post-ED support provides. <br />Keywords: suicide, prevention, safety plan, caring messages, postcards, emergency department, follow-up, contacts, brief intervention</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5654,"|Implementing an SBIRT Pilot Utilizing Student-mediated Screenings and Brief Interventions|","<p>Background: Excessive alcohol use is linked to numerous morbidities, in addition to the enormous economic impact on healthcare. Screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a proven, effective tool in reducing alcohol use; however it is severely underutilized due to barriers such as provider time constraints and lack of confidence. Numerous missed opportunities exist regarding screening and early intervention, which could significantly improve patient outcomes. An SBIRT pilot utilizing student-mediated brief interventions could serve to increase provider confidence and awareness, as well as overcome time constraint barriers. </p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose is to implement an SBIRT pilot at a campus clinic, utilizing nurse practioner (NP) students to conduct universal alcohol screens and brief interventions (BI) as a means to overcome barriers to accepting an evidenced based practice. </p>
<p>Methods: Intervention group (IG) of two providers were matched with NP students to perform screens and BI’s (n=111), while a comparison group (CG) of three providers conducted usual care (n=41). Single question screens were administered universally, followed by an AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and BI for positive screens. A pre/post pilot provider attitude survey was administered to gauge provider acceptance. </p>
<p>Results: Of 109 patients screened, 52% tested positive requiring a full AUDIT, 56% of AUDITS were positive requiring BI’s, 88% agreed to a BI, and 93% agreed to reduce alcohol intake.

5655,"|Improving Acute Care Nurses&#039; Attitudes Towards Patients with Mental Illness|","<p>Purpose: The purpose of this evidence-based practice project is to implement an educational program on mental illness for acute care nurses and measure the impact on their attitudes towards caring for mentally ill patients in an acute care setting.  Background and Significance:  Patients experiencing mental illness are more likely to have multiple risk factors for chronic illness and die at a younger age than the general population.  Patients with mental illness face negative attitudes and stigma surrounding their disease process.  A literature review indicated that nurses in acute care settings often lack knowledge and perceived competence when caring for patients with co-morbid mental and physical illness, and express a negative attitude towards patients experiencing mental illness.  </p>
<p>Methods:  The Attitudes Towards Acute Mental Health (33) questionnaire was used to measure the attitudes of 36 new graduate registered nurses working in acute care before and after they participated in a two-hour educational program.  Data was analyzed using a paired t-test.  </p>
<p>Outcomes:  A paired-samples t test was calculated to compare the mean pre-test score to the mean post-test score of the ATAMH (33).  The mean on the pre-test was 165.95 (sd = 10.88), and the mean on the post-test was 153.92 (sd = 9.14).  A significant decrease from pre-test to post-test ATAMH (33) scores was found (t(36) = 6.03, p &lt;.001).  Conclusion:  Acute care nurses’ negative attitudes towards patients with mental illness were reduced after nurses attended a two-hour educational program on mental illness.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5656,"|Improving Confidence in Suicide Risk Assessment in Psychiatric Urgent Care|","<p>The utilization of suicide risk assessment tools is a critical component of a comprehensive approach to suicide risk assessment. However, some professionals hesitate to utilize screening tools routinely in practice. A project was undertaken to determine if the utilization of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Scale (C-SSRS) improved staff confidence in assessing suicide risk. Professionals within a psychiatric urgent care in Scottsdale, Arizona were provided with<br />training on the C-SSRS. Participants then utilized the C-SSRS at triage with patients presenting with depression and/or suicidality over a two-month period. Self confidence in assessing suicide risk was evaluated utilizing The Efficacy in Assessing and Managing Suicide Risk Scale (SETSP-S). The acceptability and usability of the C-SSRS was evaluated utilizing The System Usability Scale (SUS). Findings of the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test indicated changes in pre and posttest assessment scores as significant in seven of the eight assessment parameters. In addition, Cohen's effect size value suggested medium or large clinical significance in these same assessment parameters. Evidence suggests that efficient and effective assessment can improve staff confidence in assessing for suicidality and may improve morbidity and mortality rates for patients. The utilization of tools such as the C*SSRS could reduce health care costs associated with unnecessary hospital admissions as well as rehospitalizations. The routine utilization of assessment tools such as the C-SSRS many also be beneficial to healthcare specialties outside of behavioral health such as emergency departments and urgent care settings.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Consequently, about 70% of Americans would prefer to die at home with their families, yet only 25% die according to their wishes (State of California Department of Justice, n.d). In alignment with the Peaceful End of Life Theory, the purpose of this evidence-based project is to increase primary healthcare providers’ level of skills and confidence in end-of-life discussions. This project utilized a pre and post study design. A total of 11 participants were recruited using convenience sampling from three primary care clinics in Phoenix, Arizona. Due to the small sample size and assumption of a non-normal distribution of the data, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis. There were clinical and statistical significant improvements in the EOL knowledge of the participants after the implementation of the two-and-a-half-hour Serious Illness Care Program (Z = -2.950, p = .003) with a large effect size (r = -0.62).

5660,"|Improving Metabolic monitoring for Children prescribed Second-Generation Antipsychotics|","<p>The number of children taking second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) is increasing. While SGAs produce fewer neurological side effects, the metabolic side effects of SGAs increase the risk for future cardiometabolic disease. In 2011, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry endorsed following guidelines established in 2004 recommending that people taking SGAs receive regular metabolic screening including waist circumference measurement, fasting blood glucose, and fasting lipids. Despite recommendations, studies have shown that children do not receive routine metabolic monitoring. Provider attitudes toward following guidelines can influence the rates of monitoring. Research suggests that monitoring rates improve after psychiatric providers receive educational programs on SGA use and recommended guidelines. In response to these findings, an evidence-based educational intervention discussing SGA use in children and recommended metabolic monitoring was proposed to increase the rates of metabolic monitoring in a community-based psychiatric practice that treats children. While no results were statistically significant, the average attitude score of providers toward following guidelines was higher post-education and the proportion of providers who ordered screening tests post-education increased. To further improve metabolic monitoring, it is recommended that interventions designed to increase the subjective norms and perceived behavioral control of providers be implemented. The main limitations of this project were the small sample size and the use of self-reports to assess provider ordering of screening tests.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

The physiological changes that happen during pregnancy can adversely affect women’s oral health and place her at risk for pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage and preeclampsia. The unborn child’s health can also be affected by premature birth and low birth weight. Although professional organizations have evidence-based practice guidelines for both prenatal and dental providers, the evidence shows a gap between recommendations and practice. An oral health promotion project for pregnant women was implemented in a federally qualified community health center where there was a lack of adherence to the guidelines.  The purpose of this project was to implement established oral health screening guidelines for pregnant women and to increase dental visits among pregnant women. For this project, a two-item maternal oral health-screening tool (MOS) for the prenatal providers was added into the electronic health record to standardize and document oral health screening for pregnant women at their first prenatal visit. After three months of implementation, there was a significant increase in maternal oral health screening and referral.

<p>Background: Asthma is a chronic illness that impacts 10.9% of the pediatric population in Arizona. Poor asthma understanding and management leads to high-utilization of emergency rooms and urgent care clinics, negatively impacting the healthcare economy. Poor asthma management also leads to decreased health outcomes and impacts on the child’s academic functioning, mental health, and overall quality of life. Current evidence supports use of written asthma action plans (WAAP) and inhaler/spacer instruction to improve asthma management. </p>
<p>Methods: The intervention was an evidence-based educational session provided to the staff of a military, pediatric primary care clinic in southwest Arizona regarding the use of WAAP, the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and integrated inhaler/spacer instruction. Chart reviews were conducted to evaluate the documentation of use of WAAP, ACT, and inhaler/spacer education.  </p>
<p>Results: Charts were collected from pre-intervention (n = 33) and post-intervention (n = 18). Data analysis demonstrated a statistically significant higher use of WAAP (U = 0.008,  p &lt; 0.05, d = 0.83). Although there was not a statistically significant change in use of ACT tool, Cohen’s value (d = 0.48) suggested a moderate positive effect.

While emphasis on preconception and prenatal care has increased nationwide, attendance at this important visit is on the decline. The purpose of this project was to investigate how enhanced prenatal education and concurrent scheduling of a well-baby visit at four weeks, instead of the traditional six weeks, could increase adherence to recommended follow-up care at a federally qualified health clinic in the Southwestern United States. The Theory of Reasoned Action guided the intervention while Rosswurum and Larrabee’s evidence-based practice model was used to develop the project. The pre-existing weekly prenatal education program was enhanced with information regarding the importance of a four-week postpartum follow-up visit. Front desk schedulers were educated to offer same day appointments for the postpartum care visit and one-month well-baby appointment. Data collection took place for three months after implementation of the project and was compared to adherence rates during the three months prior to the intervention. Providers and scheduling staff members participated in a short post-intervention interview. Prenatal education and convenience of concurrent scheduling increased the percentage of adherence to follow-up visits over a three-month period.

5666,"|Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening in the Primary Care Setting|","<p>Purpose:  The purpose of this project was to implement a change in workflow to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates and improve Meaningful Use scores in a primary care setting.</p>
<p>Background and Significance: CRC is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among men and women.  Current CRC screening rates remain low, even with advanced screening options available.  Meaningful Use sets specific objectives for health care providers to achieve.  Documenting CRC screening status and recommending CRC screenings to patients is one of the objectives of Meaningful Use and is considered a Clinical Quality Measure (HealthIT.gov).  Factors that lead to CRC screening include primary care providers (PCPs) raising the topic, involving support staff, involving patients in the decision-making process, and setting alerts in electronic health records (EHRs).</p>
<p>Methods:  The Health Belief Model and Ottawa Model of Research Use helped guide this project.  The project took place at a private primary care practice.  The focus was on patients between the ages of 50 and 75 years old meeting criteria for CRC.  Five PCPS and five medical assistants (MAs) chose to participate in the study.  Participants were given pre and post Practice Culture Assessment (PCA) surveys to measure perceptions of the practice culture.  The project included a three-part practice change: PCP and MA education about CRC screening guidelines, EHR documentation and reminders, and a change of patient visit workflow which included having MAs review patient's CRC screening status before they were seen by the PCP and handing out CRC screening brochures when appropriate.  PCPs then ordered the appropriate CRC screening, and the MA documented the screening in the EHR under a designated location.  CRC Screening Project Evaluation Forms were completed by MAs after each patient visit.</p>
<p>Outcomes:  No significant difference from pre to post survey satisfaction scores were found (t (8) = - 1.542, p= = .162).  Means of quantitative data were reported from the CRC screening evaluation forms; N=91.  The most common method of screening chosen was colonoscopy, 87%.  A strong correlation was found (r (-.293) = .01, p&lt;.05) between receiving a CRC brochure and choosing a form of screening.  Meaningful Use scores pre and post project are pending.</p>
<p>Conclusion:  Patients are more likely to choose a screening method when the topic is raised in a primary care setting.  Continued staff education on workflow is important to sustain this change.

5667,"|Increasing Influenza Immunization Rates at a Homeless Clinic Through Staff Education|","<p>Background: Healthy People 2020, a government organization that sets health goals for the United States, has established the benchmark objective of 70% influenza vaccination coverage. National trends show immunization rates are a dismal 41.7% for the adult population. Persons<br />experiencing homelessness are a vulnerable population in which access to preventative health care services is lacking. Prevention of acute illness, whenever possible, is crucial to maintaining the health of this population. The purpose of this project is to increase influenza vaccinations through staff education at a homeless clinic.</p>
<p>Methods: Eighty-eight volunteer staff, at a student led homeless clinic, received education on the influenza vaccinations. The education occurred at the first orientation meeting of the fall semester in 2016 and consisted of; the importance of immunizations, goals of Healthy People 2020, and an emphasis on addressing patient objections. The effectiveness of the program<br />compared the percentage of patients immunized from August - December 2016 to 2015.</p>
<p>Results: Post intervention, 44% of the clinic patients were immunized against influenza,<br />compared to 18% (pre-intervention). This finding resulted in a statistically significant increase in<br />vaccinations (Z= -5.513, p= &lt; .001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

It can be difficult for clinicians to manage these symptoms while balancing patient safety concerns and preferences. Shared decision-making (SDM) can assist both the provider and patient to navigate the various treatment options, minimizing gaps between their preferences. To assess the effect of SDM in a nurse-led practice in the Southwest, two nurse practitioners (NP) were invited to use a menopausal decision aid (DA). Women aged 40 to 64 years experiencing VMS were invited to participate in the project. Following a visit with the NP in which the DA was used, patients completed a six question post-intervention survey based on both the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and SDM-Q-9 surveys. Patients were also asked to complete a telephone interview about the process 1-2 weeks post-intervention. The NP completed a post-intervention survey based on the SDM-Q-Doc to assess clinician satisfaction with the SDM process. Eight patients (mean age, 47.9 years), presenting with a range of 2 to 6 perimenopausal symptoms participated in the project. All patients (100%) strongly or completely agreed that the clinician precisely explained the advantages &amp; disadvantages of treatment options, helped them understand all the information, reached an agreement on how to proceed with care, and were extremely satisfied or satisfied with their decision and making an informed choice.

5670,"|Interprofessional Collaboration in Management of Type 2 diabetes with Attention to Social Determinants of Health|","<p>Interprofessional collaboration (IP) is an approach used by healthcare organizations to improve the quality of care. Studies examining effects of IP with patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have shown improvement in A1C, blood pressure, lipids, self-efficacy and overall greater knowledge of disease process and management. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the impact of IP with attention to identifying and addressing social needs of patients with T2DM.  Participants at least 18 years of age with an A1C &gt;6.5% were identified; Spanish speaking patients were included in this project. The intervention included administration of Health Leads questionnaire to assess social needs. Monthly in person or phone meetings were conducted during a 3-month period. The patient had the option to meet with the doctor of nursing practice (DNP) student as well as other members of the team including the clinical pharmacist and social work intern. Baseline A1C levels were extracted from chart at 1st monthly meeting. Post A1C levels were drawn at the 3 month follow up with their primary care provider. Study outcomes include the difference in A1C goal attainment, mean A1C and patient satisfaction.  Pre A1C levels in participants ranged from 7.1% to 9.8% with a mean of 8.3%. Post A1C levels ranged from 6.9% to 8.6% with a mean of 7.7%. Two cases were excluded as they did not respond to the intervention. A paired-samples t test was calculated to compare the mean pre A1C level to the post A1C level. The mean pre A1C level was 8.24 (sd .879), and the post A1C level was 7.69 (sd .631). A significant decrease from pre to post A1C levels was found (t (6) = 2.82, p&lt;.05). The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is on the rise, as are the costs.

5671,"|Interprofessional Collaborative Education in Mental Health|Exploring Attitudes and Beliefs About Collaboration and Teamwork","<p>Purpose: Assess provider perceptions on care coordination, collaboration, teamwork, and shared decision-making practices pre and post a brief educational intervention on interprofessional collaboration (IPC).  <br />Background and significance: A lack of care coordination and active follow up in the outpatient setting of individuals living with mental illness places this population at high risk for developing various comorbidities. Care coordination across care providers and patients in a IPC, patient-centered treatment model of care is an intervention that can reduce this barrier to care.  <br />Methods: At a behavioral health clinic in the southwestern United States (U.S.) twenty-two participants were assessed via the Collaborative Practice Assessment Tool (CPAT), before and after an educational presentation on IPC care.  The CPAT is a tool that was developed to assess collaborative practice within teams and help identify needs for professional development.  <br />Results: Statistical significance was found from pretest to posttest scores (t(21) = -1.936, p = .066). Statistical significance was found in two of the eight domains; mission, meaningful purpose, and goals (p = .009) and decision-making and conflict management (p = .058).  Increases in posttest scores were seen in all eight domains.<br />Conclusions: Training behavioral health professionals in IPC practice and teambuilding may facilitate improved clinical team experiences and communication. Behavioral health professionals treating individuals living with serious mental illness (SMI), IPC training could prepare providers to work more effectively and efficiently in the delivery of patient-centered care in this population with complex health care needs.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Medical patient portals have the potential to provide patients with timely, transparent access to health care information and engage them in their health care process and management. This may result in improved disease management outcomes.</p>
<p>Methods: This project was guided by a The Rosswurm and Larrabee Model for Change to Evidence- Based Practice and Pender’s health promotion framework. IRB Approved by ASU. The instruction was implemented at an urban clinic in downtown phoenix that serves uninsured and underserved individuals. Uninsured participants were recruited (n=50). A survey pre and post registration was conducted to assess knowledge and medical portal participation in addition a random pre and post chart review was performed.</p>
<p>Results: Descriptive statistics was used to describe sample and outcome variables. A chi-square test of independence was calculated comparing pre and post intervention significant change was found (χ2 (1) = .002, P&lt;0.05.), a paired sample t test was calculated to compare knowledge pre and post registration instruction the mean pre-10.187(SD = 4.422), post mean was 16.958(SD=.856). A significant increase of knowledge was found (t (47) =-9.573, p (&lt;.001).</p>
<p>Outcomes: In this population both patients and providers have seen significant benefits such as increased communication and patient participation, from the implementation of evidence based educational tools such as instruction with teach back, and the usage of brochures. Potential Implication for sustainability includes the lack of a designated individual that is bilingual to register patients, making patients aware of the existence of a medical patient portal, patient’s fear of sharing immigration status.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

A time-honored, integral means of support in many industries is mentorship. This is a dynamic, evolving relationship between an experienced professional and a novice professional that promotes knowledge application, systems navigation, organizational socialization and personal role integration. Unfortunately, healthcare organizations have been slow to adopt mentorship, as evidenced by the paucity of studies on mentorship programs in health care, and APP turnover rates twice that of physicians. This evidenced-based project expands on the limited existing studies regarding the associations between mentorship and organizational commitment, as well as explores the desired characteristics of quality mentors and perceived barriers to APP mentorship. A survey of multispecialty APPs at an oncology practice within a larger, multi-state integrated healthcare delivery system reveals access to mentors and time are the biggest barriers. The most desired mentorship characteristics are professional knowledge and motivational support. Career development through mentorship can increase job satisfaction and retention, as well as improve the quality of care provided by APPs.

5674,"|Minimizing Parental Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the NICU|An Efficacy Analysis of Trauma Counseling","<p>The birth of a new baby is known to be a joyful time for families.  However, such a treasured experience can quickly reroute in a matter of moments which leaves the family feeling helpless, frightened, and guilty.  The innate process of bonding and attachment is interrupted by the resuscitative course following a traumatic birth.  Separation, grief, anger, and fear promote what’s being deemed more and more frequently as parental posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Rates of parental PTSD associated with separation at birth are equivalating those of post-partum depression and post-partum psychosis.  Emotionally unstable parents are unable to adequately care for their newborn for both short and long term needs.  Facilitation and support of the parental role in an altered environment, such as a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), is thought to create opportunities for relationship security.  Establishment of an emotionally invested caregiver has been proven to minimize sequelae of the NICU patient, reduce length of stay, cut readmission rates, and lower the incidence of failure to thrive post-discharge.  A parental psychosocial program was instituted in a 32-bed NICU within a southwest children’s hospital.  The program efficacy was analyzed several months after implementation. Results are concurrent with the thought that individual counseling for NICU families reduces stress scores and improves patient satisfaction at discharge.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Beyond comorbid conditions – weight gain can lead to poor self-image, poor compliance and treatment outcomes in an already stigmatized population. Caregivers were selected as participants as they are a primary support in this population. In alignment with the Health Belief Model the purpose of this evidence-based intervention was to increase risk awareness, increase knowledge of strategies to offset risk, increase confidence and self-efficacy and empower health related behaviors among caregivers. Participants were identified by providers in an outpatient mental health clinic as caregivers of patients prescribed atypical anti-psychotic medications adults aged 18 and above, able to read and understand English, and agree to provide consent. They were asked to (1) complete a demographic and knowledge pre-test, gauge perceived knowledge/confidence, (2) view an educational PowerPoint focused on atypical anti-psychotic medications, benefits, risks and strategies to mitigate weight-gain, and (3) complete a knowledge post-test and gauge perceived knowledge/confidence. Descriptive statistics were used to examine distribution of variables, due to small sample size, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to compare outcomes. Qualitative data was also gathered to further develop interventions and inform practice. Comparison between pre- and post-test analysis demonstrated improvement in all areas of knowledge, perceived knowledge, and perceived confidence. Statistical analysis demonstrated statistical significance and high practical significance.

<p>Background:  Middle-aged women experience distinct physiological and psychosocial factors that contribute to weight gain and make obesity management especially challenging. The evidence supports the use of motivational interviewing (MI) interventions as a highly effective approach to obesity management in combination with standard medical weight loss programs.  Educating NPs that provide medical weight loss on basic MI counseling techniques is necessary to facilitate the use of this intervention.</p>
<p>Methods: NP providers at a group of seven medical weight loss clinics in the southwestern United States completed an online MI educational module that was developed for this project.  The module content covered basic MI counseling techniques. MI knowledge was assessed using a 6-item pre/post-test. Participants completed an 8-item course evaluation to provide additional feedback. </p>
<p>Results: Ten of the 13 NPs eligible participated in the project. The overall response to the project was positive as demonstrated by high scores on the course evaluation.

5677,"|Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Monitoring in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|Changing provider comfort and confidence","<p>Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project was to assess provider (MD and Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NNP)) comfort and confidence with Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring on Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients when provided with an educational teaching session.</p>
<p>Background and Significance: NIRS data can be used in conjunction with standard vital sign monitoring to help clinicians understand blood flow and metabolic demands of organ systems, particularly cerebral, renal, and mesenteric blood flow patterns. A NICU unit in the northwestern US adopted NIRS use on their patients in 2008, however, NIRS monitoring usage decreased over the past 5 years, citing a lack of continued education and comfort interpreting and managing NIRS monitored patients. One patient was monitored with NIRS in the year prior to the QI project.</p>
<p>Methods: A 5 point Likert-Type survey was designed to examine provider comfort and confidence using and interpreting NIRS on NICU patients. No Croanbach’s alpha value exists for the survey as it was purposefully designed for the QI project. An educational presentation on the use and interpretation of NIRS on NICU patients was created and delivered during a formal provider staff meeting. Pre and Post education surveys were distributed electronically to participants and were presented 1 week prior to educational session and 1 month after educational session. IBM SPSS version 23 was used for descriptive statistics, paired t tests, and Wilcoxon test. Significance set to p&lt;0.05.</p>
<p>Results: In total, 18 providers (N=18) were surveyed, and 13 paired survey results (n=13) were received (8 MD and 5 NNP). Paired-samples t tests were calculated to compare the mean total score (TS) for pre/post comfort and pre/post confidence. This was a significant improvement for both comfort (t(11) = -3.13, p=0.010) and confidence (t(11) = -3.37, p=0.006). Wilcoxon test showed a significant increase in the times a provider managed a patient with NIRS (z=-2.762, p=0.006). The number NIRS monitored patients increased from one in the previous year to 15 patients in the 5 months of data tracking, a clinically significant increase.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Providing educational session on previously utilized clinical applications can improve providers comfort and confidence and influence their usage in clinical practice. Future continuing education sessions could be designed for different clinical applications in order to keep clinicians abreast of the current evidenced based applications of advanced clinical monitors.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5679,"|Open-Access Scheduling|","<p>Declaration of Conflicts: This project has no conflicts of interest to declare.</p>
<p>Context:  This project was completed at a federally qualified primary healthcare clinic in Phoenix, Arizona that served patients of all age groups, but primarily cared for the Hispanic population providing primary care, preventative services, family planning, two lab technicians, one promoter, two medical assistant supervisors, five front desk staff, one chief administrative officer, one chief financial officer, two medical directoers who were also providers at the clinic.</p>
<p>Problem and Analysis Assessment: During my clinical rotations, I saw the burden a missed patient appointment had not only on the patients themselves, but also on the clinic, providers, and the staff.  It caused delay in treatment for patients, and it did not allow other patients that wanted to be seen to be seen.  It also increased unnecessary costs and wasted provider time.  Thereafter, I met with some of the leadership team and one of the medical directors to determine a solution to reduce the number of missed appointments that were occurring.  An educational session was kept to discuss the findings of this problem to the providers and the staff and when surveys were handed out to the patients, providers, and staff to assess their satisfaction with the old scheduling system versus the new scheduling system, they were also provided with a cover letter discussing the project.</p>
<p>Intervention: In order for improvements in care to occur, a system process change including the way patients are scheduled must occur.  In this case, an open-access scheduling system (OAS) was implemented.  OAS allows a patient to schedule an appointment on the 'same-day' or the 'next-day' to be seen.  One provider at each of the clinics, each day of the week was available for 'same-day' appointments from 1300-1600.  The providers were still available for scheduled appointments using the previous scheduling method.  Walk-ins were still accepted, and were scheduled based on patient provider preference; however, if an appointment was not available for their preferred provider, they were typically seen with the provider that was the 'same-day' provider for that day.</p>
<p>Strategy for change:  Since patients were only allowed to schedule appointments one month in advance, only one month was needed to implement this process change.  A recommendation for the future would be to clearly identify the patient encounter type, and label it as a same-day appointment, as this would be helpful when gathering and extracting data for this type of patient group specifically.</p>
<p>Measurement of Improvement:  Over a three-month period, a data collection plan was used to determine the number of Mas over a three-month period before and after implementation of this change.  Satisfaction scores were measured using likert scales for patients, provider, and staff, and a dichotomous scale was used to determine the likelihood of emergency room or urgent care use.  A comparison was done to measure revenue during the same time frame.  During the three months, a clinically significant decrease in MAs was seen (&lt;0.52%), with an increase in revenue by 41%.  Additionally, a statistically significant increase in patient, provider and staff satisfaction was also noted when compared to the old scheduling system, as &gt;68% of all patients, providers and staff reported feeling either very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the new scheduling system.  Additionally, patients also reported that they were less likely to visit an emergency room(88%) or urgent care (90%) since they were able to be seen the same-day or the next-day by a provider.</p>
<p>Effects of changes: An incidental finding occurred during this study - where 877 more patients were seen in the three months during the implementation of this project, compared to the three months prior; which likely resulted in a 41% increase in revenue.  Additionally this project, allowed patients that wanted to be seen on the same day, to be seen, and it decreased unnecessary costs associated with emergency room or urgent care visits.  Some of the limitations involved included the current political environment, appointment slots that were previously 15 minutes in length (in 2016), increased to 20 minutes in length (in 2017), a language barrier was noted for the patient surveys since English was not the first language for many of the patients who completed the survey (although documents were translated), and the surveys used were not reliable instrument given that a reliable instrument in previous studies could not be found.</p>
<p>Lessons learnt:  In order to have accuracy of the survey results, it is best for the author of the study to hand out and provide scripture for the survey so that complete data is received from the surveyors.</p>
<p>Messages for others: Begin by making a small process change where only one provider allows for the open-access scheduling so that the entire office is not affected by it, and if results begin to look promising then it can be expanded.  Additionally, correct labeling of patients as 'same-day' is also important so that additional data can be gathered when needed regarding the 'same-day' patients.</p>
<p>Patient/Family/Guardian Involvement:  Patients who benefited from the new scheduling system (open-access scheduling) were asked to fill out a survey that asked them to disclose some demographic data and asked them to determine their satisfaction with the new vs old scheduling system and their likelihood of visiting an emergency room or urgent care.</p>

5680,"|Opioid Management|Provider Education","<p>Over the last two decades, opioid prescription and prevalence has increased to account for over 33,000 deaths per year (Soelberg, Brown, Du Vivier, Meyer &amp; Ramachandran, 2017). This is not only due to overdose, but misuse, abuse, and addiction. The abrupt increase in prescriptions, pills dispensed, and opioid-related deaths have encouraged the involvement of multiple entities. In 2016, the opioid crisis gained the attention of communities that released guidelines to regulate prescription of opioid pain management. Such entities include the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute on Drug Abuse, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Arizona Department of Health Services (AZDHS), and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Evidence shows that prescribing practices between providers vary. It also shows that providers lack knowledge of appropriate opioid prescribing and management.

5681,"|Oral Dextrose Gel in the Treatment of Neonatal Hypoglycemia|An Evidence Based Practice Change","<p>Background: Neonatal hypoglycemia (NH) is a common problem in the newborn period that resolves by 24-48 hours of life.  Infants with known NH risk factors take longer to achieve blood glucose homeostasis.  The leading cause of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions in otherwise healthy term and late preterm infants is NH.</p>
<p>Purpose: To determine the efficacy of dextrose gel in addition to oral feedings in NH treatment as compared to the previous practice of oral feedings alone.  Lewin's change theory was used in staff education and project implementation.</p>
<p>Methods/Search Strategy: A keyword search of CINHAL, Cochrane, and PubMed with restrictions to English and publications within 5 years revealed supportive data for the practice change.  IRB approval obtained prior to the practice change. Nurses screened all newborns for NH risk factors at birth at a tertiary hospital in the southwestewrn U.S. Infants with specific criteria received oral dextrose gel with timed follow-up blood glucose levels following an NH algorithm.</p>
<p>Findings/Results:  Two groups of infants with similar gestational ages, birth weights, and risk factors for NH were compared pre and post-implementation of the EBP change.  Inftants in the first group (n=27) were all born prior to the start of the project and therefore were all treated with IV dextrose in the NICU after failing to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges with oral feedings alone.  The second group of infants (n=27) was treated based on an updated NH algorithm after implementation of the use of oral dextrose gel.  Of those 27 infants, 24 received oral dextrose gel for NH treatment.  Of resipratory distress in addition to NH so these infants were excluded in the statistical analysis of NICU admissions.  Therefore the post-implementation group only had 2 admission for primary diagnosis of NH.  When comparing admission rates for hypoglycemia between the two groups, the first group had a 100% admission rate while the second group (those who received oral dextrose gel) only had a 9% admission rate for neonatal hypoglycemia (p&lt;0.001).<br />Upon further investigation it was found that these 2 infants admitted to the NICU with the diagnosis of NH had multiple risk factors present, including being infants of diabetic mothers which means they likely experienced refractory hypoglycemia after treatment with oral dextrose gel secondary to hyperinsulinism.  Hyperinsulinism can lead to persistent and profound hypoglycemia in the newborn that is more difficult to treat, which is of clinical significance.</p>
<p>Implications for Practice:  Early identification with timely follow-up blood glucose levels following intervention may be critical to successful treatment without requiring NICU admission.  Nursing education and parental support are also paramount to success.  If the change in NICU admissions for NH is statistically significant with a larger sample size, results may be shared with other facilities that traditionally transfer these infants for a higher level of care.</p>

5682,"|Patient Education and Medication Adherence|","<p>Purpose/Aims: The purpose of this project was to evaluate how patient education can improve medication adherence.<br />Background and Significance: An exhaustive literature search was conducted with critical appraisal and evidence synthesis to evaluate the effectiveness of patient education on medication adherence. The search concluded that adherence is crucial to chronic disease processes. However, there was no one intervention that emerged as being superior for improving medication<br />adherence. Working with patients individually to address needs through a variety of methods appeared was the best way to improve medication non-adherence.<br />Methods: A project to improve medication adherence in an outpatient mental health clinic incorporated electronic medical record (EMR) technology with patient education materials. The project evaluated provider satisfaction with the EMR handout system and evaluated providers’ perceptions of improved medication adherence. Providers (n=9) were followed for eight weeks once system was live. Appraisal was conducted on the providers and pre-test, mid project test, and an eight week post-test were administered. The instrument used was the Technology Acceptance Model-2 (TAM-2).<br />Outcomes: Friedman Test was conducted. Results obtained showed no significant difference between the three tests (χ2 (2) =2.889, p&gt;0.05). The pretest had a standard deviation of 14.24. The posttest standard deviation was 23.75.<br />Conclusion: Providers educate patients about a variety of topics such as chronic conditions and wellness.

5683,"|Patient Portals|An Educational Project to Improve Provider Readiness","<p>Background: With the adoption of the Health Information Technology for Economical and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, came the implementation of the electronic health record (EHR) and incentivized provider programs called Meaningful Use (MU). A goal of MU is to utilize patient portals to improve access to care. Current evidence supports patient portal use however providers are concerned about increased work load and lost revenue because of the time spent managing the portals rather than providing direct, billable patient care.  </p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of this project was to assess provider readiness for patient portals and provide an educational intervention to address perceived barriers. </p>
<p>Method: Ten providers at a large family practice clinic in the southwest United States were surveyed using The Provider Readiness Questionnaire prior to and after an educational intervention addressing common concerns. </p>
<p>Results: Improved response to patient portal use after the provider viewed the learning module. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare pre-and post-intervention responses. There was a statistically significant difference in the scores for the question “increase my workload” Pretest (M= 3.78, SD=1.201) and; Posttest (M=2.67, SD=1.225) ;(t (8) =5.547, p = .001). There was also a statistically significant difference for the question “increased provider professional satisfaction” Pretest (M=3.89, SD= .333) and Posttest (M= 4.44, SD=.527); t (8) = -2.294, p=.051). </p>

5686,"|Pediatric Shoulder Rehabilitation|","<p>Objectives<br />As a result of increased participation in competitive sports, shoulder instability, subluxations, and dislocations are common injuries in the adolescent athlete. These injuries worsen when athletes over train, make physical contact, and do not take enough time for rest between injuries. Protocols and therapies need to be implemented to prevent subsequent injuries, including progressive measurement of rehabilitation and return to play (RTP) outcomes. The goal of treatment for these athletes is to return them to their previous level of performance and prevent re-injury. </p>
<p>The purpose of this quality improvement evidence-based project was to determine if the use of the Pediatric Adolescent Shoulder Survey (PASS) affects return to play. The aims of this project were to determine if there was a change in return to play (RTP) outcomes, compare length of RTP between operative and non-operative groups, and determine if PASS scores improved over time.</p>
<p>Methods<br />The PASS is a 13 item, patient reported outcomes (PROs) survey assessing symptoms, limitations, compensatory mechanisms, and emotional distress. It is reliable and valid for athletes who have acute shoulder injuries and decreased range of motion or strength. </p>
<p>After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the institution and university, providers at a southwestern sports medicine clinic were educated on administration and scoring of the survey. Surveys were administered to athletes ages 8-18 who presented with shoulder injuries at intervals. Retrospective and prospective chart reviews were obtained at baseline (control group) and post intervention (intervention group). Return to play (RTP) days and Pediatric Adolescent Shoulder Survey scores were recorded.</p>
<p>Results <br />Independent t-tests were calculated to compare mean RTP days from control and intervention groups, RTP for operative and non-operative groups within the control and intervention groups. Statistically significant t (20) = -2.827, p = 0.03) differences were noted between operative group for the intervention group, (n=9), M=136.00 (SD=51.49) days vs non-operative group, M= 83.68 (SD=31.78) days. No statistically significant difference between control group M =118.68 (SD=55.95) days and intervention group M=107.52 (48.77) days was noted. PASS scores showed improvement over time. </p>
<p>Conclusion<br />The PASS instrument may positively affect RTP. There was a significant change in RTP for the whole group. Non-operative patients RTP sooner than operative for the whole sample. PASS scores improved over time for all patients.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5687,"|Perceived Social Support and Quality of Life among Clients Participating in Cancer Support Services|","<p>Purpose:  To collect and analyze participant demographic information and explore use of instruments to measure perceived social support and quality of life at a local cancer support program. Specific objectives included: 1) Gather and analyze participant demographic information and program utilization by participants for a non-profit cancer support agency, 2) Assess the extent to which those using the support programs experience perceived social support (PSS) and quality of life (QOL), and 3) Assess the utility of the survey process and selected instruments to guide program planning.<br />Background: Obtaining the diagnosis of cancer is traumatic, but support groups assist in emotional healing among group members. There is strong evidence correlating support group participation with PSS and QOL. The Wilson and Cleary model of QOL clearly links social support and QOL and provided the conceptual framework for this project. <br />Methods: A survey for self-reported participant demographics, support activities, QOL scores, and PSS scores was implemented. Both online and pencil and paper surveys were available. Instruments included the Flanagan Quality of Life Scale (Cronbach’s α = .82 to .92) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) and a demographic survey created for this project. <br />Outcomes: All but one survey was completed online (n=48).  Respondents were primarily white, female, cancer free at the time of the survey, and over the age of 55. QOL and PSS scores within this sample emulated previous research of correlations between instruments and people with chronic illnesses. <br />Conclusion: Correlations of sample demographics and instrument scores reflected current literature; this project validates an effective and affordable means to evaluate program effectiveness. Future use of the survey is to better tailor services to meet the objectives of the agency <br />to improve QOL for all individuals affected by cancer.</p>

5689,"|Preoperative Education for Patients Undergoing Spine Surgery|","<p>Low back pain is a worldwide health problem.  Preoperative education is essential to provide patients with information across the continuum of care. Gaps exist among healthcare organizations regarding deficiencies in properly educating patients about their surgical experience. The lack of proper preoperative education can negatively impact reimbursement for healthcare systems, providers, and patient outcomes.  In a large metropolitan tertiary care center providing spine surgery, an evidence-based project was implemented.  A self-developed pre and post intervention surveys was given assessing patients’ knowledge and surgical expectations after surgery. A tri-fold education pamphlet was given to the participants with information that included detailed information regarding expectations before and after surgery.  Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and outcome variable. An increase in knowledge in expectations after surgery was noted from pre-intervention (mean 1.83, SD .408) to post-intervention (mean 1.67, SD .816) with a Cohen’s D of 0.248 although this was not statistically significant. However, the change in average length of stay (LOS) was significant.  The average LOS for the project participants dropped from 4.54 days to 2.833 days which is within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines of 2.92 days for this surgical population.

5692,"|Quality Assurance Project to Implement Audiovisual Distraction in Pediatric Radiation Oncology|","<p>Approximately 15,270 children were diagnosed with cancer last year and a common treatment includes daily radiation therapy. Children must remain immobilized for the planning and treatment to ensure the radiation beam precisely delivers radiation to the tumor and reduces exposure to the normal surrounding tissue. Radiation therapy may last several weeks, which requires children to be put under daily anesthesia for an extended length of time to ensure immobilization. The risks for anesthesia include airway obstruction, broncho/laryngospasm, oxygen desaturation, apnea, nausea/vomiting, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, cardiac arrest, sepsis due to central line access, and death.  The relationship between daily anesthesia administration and neurotoxicity is currently unclear.  The purpose of audiovisual distraction (AVD) during radiation therapy was to decrease anesthesia exposure, improve quality of life, and decrease anxiety of patients and families. A plan to implement an AVD device at the time of radiation planning and during daily treatments was conducted in a large pediatric radiation oncology practice in Arizona. Inclusion criteria were children needing radiation, between the ages of 5 and 15, who do not have history or complaint of visual impairment, who have the ability to follow directions for AVD, and were deemed candidates by the Radiation Oncologist and Child Life Specialist through physical and mental assessment. Data collection included anesthesia requirements, heart rate, PedsQL Tool, and time in treatment room gathered at the planning session and at the end of treatment. Microsoft SPSS was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and outcome variables. The aggregated data was analyzed to ascertain if the number of children in the inclusion age range had a decreased need for anesthesia, decreased anxiety, and increased quality of life. The primary outcome for the AVD was: all four children who participated were able to undergo radiation therapy without the need for anesthesia . The children were able to remain awake for treatment could attend school, as permissible, eat before treatment, and spend significantly less time at the treatment facility. The concern of repetitive anesthesia and neurotoxicity will not be a factor in the child’s long term late effects of treatment. The reduction of need on anesthesia staff and nursing staff was estimated to save over 500,000 dollars for the 89 treatments the four children underwent with the AVD. The benefits of the intervention not only provided a better treatment experience for all children, but it  allowed the facility to utilize the treatment machine more efficiently, providing radiation therapy as an option to even more patients.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Through interprofessional collaboration, the process change was designed and implemented with the residents and Physician Assistants of the urology practice. There was a 93% adherence rate in delivering the survivorship care plans during the project. The “Confidence in Survivorship Information” questionnaire was used to measure the patients’ confidence in survivorship information prior to and after receiving a survivorship care plan. A paired t-test showed statistical significance in improvement in confidence in the knowledge of long-term physical effects of cancer treatment, strategies for preventing and treating long-term physical effects, and resources available for family members who may be at risk.

5694,"|Recruiting Rural Nurses to Become Advanced Practice Registered Nurses in Rural Colorado|","<p>Rural healthcare leaders are increasingly tasked with the responsibility of providing health access to 21% of the national population with only 10% of the provider workforce (Sonenberg, Knepper, &amp; Pulcini, 2015). Provider recruitment strategies offering loan repayment have had some success in the short term, but are less impactful at creating a long-term retention rate, unless the providers have an existing connection to either the community in which they are working or rural healthcare (Renner et al., 2010). Responding to this data, a demonstration project has been created in Colorado to test a rural focused “grow your own” advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) model. This model is designed to recruit RNs from inside rural communities to return to school and become primary care providers within those communities upon graduation. The project offers stipend support with assistance in the school application process, educational support, clinical and job placement assistance, and monthly coaching. Additionally, communities are asked to provide matching funds to support the APRN students with a goal of creating a self-sustaining model that will build a continuous pipeline of APRN providers. This strategy avoids the costly need to recruit and relocate providers who have no ties to the community. The initial response from rural nurses and communities around the state has been overwhelmingly successful. This success suggests that this model could serve as a new and sustainable strategy for building a rural APRN provider workforce pipeline while ensuring access to a primary care health provider for all people living in rural areas.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5695,"|Reducing Polypharmacy with Mobile Apps Among Mental Health Patients|","<p>Polypharmacy among psychiatric patients is a concerning trend. From 2007-2010, 58.2% of women and 41.8% of men reported taking five or more prescription drugs within the last 30 days (CDC, 2014). Negative outcomes include prescription drug abuse, side effects, interactions, treatment failure, patient dissatisfaction, and lack of treatment control. The associated practice challenges have led to the following PICOT question. In persons with mental health issues receiving care at an outpatient mental health clinic, does engaging in mindfulness practice versus no mindfulness practice change polypharmacy use over a 3-month period? The project purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of Insight Timer mobile mindfulness app at helping patients self-manage distressing symptoms and reduce polypharmacy. Over three weeks, mental health clinic nurse practitioners (NPs) voluntarily recruited patients (n=12) over age 18 using as needed prescriptions (PRNs), and agreed to use Insight Timer mobile mindfulness app for adjunct symptom management. Consenting participants downloaded the mobile app, and completed a brief questionnaire measuring PRN use at the start of app use, and PRN use at their next visit. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a 10-week mindfulness app trial did not significantly lower total PRN doses compared with pre-app dosing (Z = -.534, p = .593). Paired t-tests revealed no significant change in pre (M = 65.17, SD = 28.64) versus post (M = 67.75, SD = 20.22) OQ45 life functionality results (t(11)  = -.420, p = .683) (d = .121) as a result of app use. Clinically relevant results illustrated 83.33% of participants taking greater than nine PRN doses over the study period used the app six times or more in place of medication. High PRN users employed the app frequently in place of medication regardless of total PRN doses taken.

5697,"|Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)|Implementation in the Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatric Setting","<p>BACKGROUND: The cost of substance use (SU) in the United States (U.S.) is estimated at $1.25 trillion annually. SU is a worldwide health concern, impacting physical and psychological health of those who use substances, their friends, family members, communities and nations. Screening, Brief Intervention (BI) and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) provides an evidence-based (EB) framework to detect and treat SU. Evidence shows that mental health (MH) providers are not providing EB SU management. Federally grant-funded SBIRT demonstrated evidence of decreased SU and prevention of full disorders. Implementation outcomes in smaller-scale projects have included increased clinician knowledge, documentation and interdisciplinary teamwork. </p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: To improve quality of care (QOC) for adolescents who use substances in the inpatient psychiatric setting by implementing EB SBIRT practices.</p>
<p>METHODS: Research questions focused on whether the number of SBIRT notes documented (N=170 charts) increased and whether training of the interdisciplinary team (N=26 clinicians) increased SBIRT knowledge. Individualized interventions used existing processes, training and a new SBIRT Note template. An SBIRT knowledge survey was adapted from a similar study. A pre-and post-chart audit was conducted to show increase in SBIRT documentation. The rationale for the latter was not only for compliance, but also so that all team members can know the status of SBIRT services. Thus, increased interdisciplinary teamwork was an intentional, though indirect, outcome. </p>
<p>RESULTS:  A paired-samples t-test indicated clinician SBIRT knowledge significantly increased, with a large effect size. The results suggest that a short, 45-60-minute tailored education module can significantly increase clinician SBIRT knowledge.  Auditing screening &amp; BI notes both before and after the study period yielded important patient SU information and which types of SBIRT documentation increased post-implementation. The CRAFFT scores of the patients were quite high from a SU perspective, averaging over 3/6 both pre- and post-implementation, revealing over an 80% chance that the adolescent patient had a SU disorder. Most patients were positive for at least one substance (pre- = 47.1%; post- = 65.2%), with cannabis and alcohol being the most commonly used substances. Completed CRAFFT screenings increased from 62.5% to 72.7% of audited patients. Post-implementation, there were two types of BI notes: the preexisting Progress Note BI (PN BI) and the new Auto-Text BI (AT BI), part of the new SBIRT Note template introduced during implementation. The PN BIs not completed despite a positive screen increased from 79.6% to 83.7%. PN BIs increased 1%. The option for AT BI notes ameliorated this effect. Total BI notes completed for a patient positive for a substance increased from 20.4% to 32.6%, with 67.4% not receiving a documented BI. Total BIs completed for all patients was 21.2% post-implementation.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: This project is scalable throughout the U.S. in MH settings and will provide crucial knowledge about positive and negative drivers in small-scale SBIRT implementations. The role of registered nurses (RNs), social workers and psychiatrists in providing SBIRT services as an interdisciplinary team will be enhanced. Likely conclusions are that short trainings can significantly increase clinician knowledge about SBIRT and compliance with standards. Consistent with prior evidence, significant management involvement, SBIRT champions, thought leaders and other consistent emphasis is necessary to continue improving SBIRT practice in the target setting.</p>

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening adults for depression in primary care to increase detection, so it can be adequately managed.  Despite this recommendation, screening rates in primary care are low.  The purpose of this project was to implement a screening intervention and examine the effect of screening on the treatment of depression in older adults.</p>
<p>Methods<br />The screening intervention was implemented as an evidence-based project in a small primary care practice. Consenting adults ≥ 65 years of age were screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).  Research indicates the PHQ-9 is valid and reliable for older adults.  A post-screening chart audit was conducted to collect data and analyze the outcome of screening related to treatment.</p>
<p>Conclusions<br />A total of 38 participants were screened.  Five (13.2%) participants had a positive screening, two received treatment during the follow up period.  The number of participants who were treated after a positive screening was significant (p= .040).</p>

5699,"|Self-Help Mindfulness Group to Increase Mindfulness and Improve Stress Management in Those with Substance Use Disorders|","<p>Stress is the direct source of some health issues and the precursors to many illnesses. The effects of stress are felt by the majority of the population and is usually undertreated or overlooked as a norm of life rather than a potential source of illness. Though everyone has different thresholds of stress, chronic or constant stress is debilitating for some and can manifest itself in limitless ways. For adults with substance use disorders (SUDs), research supports that mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) could be beneficial for stress management. The techniques incorporated in mindfulness based practices can decrease the baseline stress of its practitioners by increasing their awareness and mindfulness within daily life and during stressful situations. This increase in awareness and mindfulness has shown numerous benefits that may be crucial in increasing the likelihood of sobriety for those with SUDs. Some of these benefits may include, improved stress management, improved mitigation of craving symptoms, reduced incidences of relapse, and a better quality of life. A 4-week self-help mindfulness pilot program was conducted twice within two separate residential substance recovery settings. The participant’s satisfaction and the internalization of mindfulness concepts were measured within the pre and post implementation of a self-help mindfulness class. In the pilot program, participants rated high satisfaction of the mindfulness class and showed increased levels of mindfulness through the use of the client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ-8) and the five facets of mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ-39).</p>",,"Arizona State University.

Arthritis is the leading cause of disability among American adults, with over 50 million individuals affected. The Latino population experiences a disproportionate incidence of disability attributable to arthritis compared to other populations. Evidence supports self-management education incorporating physical activity as a promising intervention for arthritis. <br />Methods<br />The intervention included a curriculum developed by the Arthritis Association, three teaching sessions, and a pre/post-test. Anticipated outcomes included decreased pain measured by the Pain Visual Numeric, decreased report of disability measured by the Stanford HAQ, and increased self-efficacy measured by the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale.  The setting was a faith-based medical clinic that services the uninsured population located within Southwest Arizona. Participants included Spanish and English speaking adults diagnosed with arthritis.<br />Results<br />Twelve participants were consented however, only eight participants completed the entire project. Although the mean pain score decreased, indicating reduced pain, it was not statistically significant (pretest- M=5.75 SD=3.19; posttest- M=5.25 SD=2.82; z (7)=-.11, p= .92). However, there was a statistically significant increase in reports of exercise after the intervention (pretest M=.83, SD=.39; posttest- M=.43, SD=.53; z (6)=-2.0, p =.046). This was in response to an non validated question developed by the primary investigator and co-investigator of, “Do you currently exercise?”.<br />Conclusions 	<br />Results include increases in reports of exercise post-intervention and decreased pain.

5702,"|Skin and Soft Tissue Infections|Using a Severity Stratification Tool to Improve Knowledge","<p>Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI’s) are a significant health concern with serious potential implications. Evidence suggests the importance of implementing a severity stratification tool to improve early identification of SSTI’s. The aim of this evidence based project is to examine if educating healthcare staff on the use of a severity stratification tool would increase staff knowledge of SSTI's. The sample consisted of 18 participants, 12 healthcare providers and 6 healthcare staff at a correctional facility in the Southwestern United States. A pre-and posttest design, including an educational session was implemented. A 14-item multiple choice self-developed questionnaire was used to evaluate participants’ knowledge of identifying and ranking SSTI’s using the CREST tool. A one tail paired t-test was performed to compare the pre-and post-test case study scores for the healthcare provider group. A significant increase from pre-test to post-test case study scores was found (t(13)= -6.19, p &lt; 0.00). Of the healthcare providers, 57% found the tool “moderately helpful.” Of the non-provider sample, 50% found the tool “extremely helpful” and plan to use the tool “all of the time.” The findings of this study suggest that implementing an educational session on a wound severity stratification tool improves staff knowledge and increases the likelihood of the tool being used in practice.

5703,"|Sleep Quality and the Effect on Functional Outcomes|","<p>Introduction: Sleep disorders can go undiagnosed if a provider is not asking the right questions; they can be characterized by loud snoring with apneic episodes that never fully wake the person, difficulty falling asleep or daytime fatigue. Poor sleep can affect activities of daily living, job performance and personal relationships. Poor sleep can be difficult to detect because some may consider it a symptom because of their lifestyle. The purpose of this study is to assess participants sleep quality and functional outcomes of poor sleep.</p>
<p>Methods: Primary care providers have an opportunity to screen for sleep disorders as part of the intake process during an office visit. The Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), has been proposed as guide to determine if a sleep disorder is affecting quality of life. This descriptive study randomly recruited 20 participants from a community health center. A 10-question survey was given to individuals over the age of 18 who can write and speak English and either have a body mass index (BMI) over 30, hypertension (HTN) or diabetes type II (DMII). Demographic information evaluated included age, gender, HTN, DMII, BMI&gt;30, marital status, sleeping alone, employment type, race, type of insurance, how many times do they wake up at night, the average number of hours slept per night and does the person work night shift.</p>
<p>Results: The study used a qualitative approach with a descriptive methodology; statistical analysis consisted of proportions, means and standard deviation to describe the study population. Participant age ranged from 33 to 72 years (M=50.1, SD= 11.32). Sixty percent were both female and married/living with partner. Despite being married/living with partner, 50% slept alone. A Mann-Whitney U test showed that there was a significant difference in four of the questions in the FOSQ-10 in which functional outcomes were not affected by being sleepy or tired.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The FOSQ-10 may serve a role in identifying patients who might benefit from a sleep study.

5704,"|SMART Hearts|Using Motivational Interviewing to Increase Cardiac Rehab Attendance","<p>One in every three deaths in the United States results from cardiovascular disease (CDC, 2013). Cardiovascular Rehabilitation (CR) is a medically supervised program designed to helpimprove cardiovascular health for patients who have experienced heart attack, heart failure,angioplasty, or heart surgery (AHA, 2016). A hospital in the southwestern region of the UnitedStates of America reports their 2016 CR attendance rate of 79 %, which is much lower than the national average of 94% (AACVPR, 2016). Motivational interviewing (MI) is a proven method used to promote a positive behavior change for cardiac rehab patients. MI includes quality improvement activities such as peer support and cardiac rehab educational classes that have shown to increase health related quality of life measures and decreased depression symptoms (Pietrabessa et al., 2017; Pack et al., 2013). Despite all the knowledge about CR and its benefits for health nationally, there are low attendance rates, therefore the purpose of this evidence-based project is to improve CR attendance rates using MI. Patients enrolled into CR participated in the motivational interviewing for eight classes. At the end of the class, they were given notecards to create Specific Measureable Achievable Realistic and Timely (SMART) Goals for themselves for that week. The measurement tools, the PHQ-9 and Dartmouth COOP is a simple, reliable, and valid tool for assessing functional status of cardiac patients and the current CR program utilizes this tool and is familiar with explaining this tool (Eaton, Young, Fergussion, Garrett, &amp; Kolbe, 2005). A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the relationship between the MI classes and the CR attendance, depression scores, and quality of life. A strong positive correlation was found (r (82)= .456, p&lt; .001) indicating a significant linear relationship between motivational interviewing and cardiac rehab attendance. A weak correlation that was not significant for depression symptoms and quality of life.

5705,"|Socio-emotional and Behavior Issues of Children Separated from Military Parent|","<p>Introduction: More than 1.2 million children in military families face long separations from a parent due to deployment or extended assignment, which can lead to significant family dysfunction as well as behavioral, emotional, and scholastic problems for the child. The purpose of From Caring 2 Coping is to identify and provide healthcare providers of military children tools to recognize and address maladaptive and externalizing behaviors of these children, while also assisting the nondeployed parent or caregiver to provide their children with the necessary support to reduce stress and increase their own coping skills. </p>
<p>Materials and Methods: After approval from Arizona State University IRB, children aged 4-11 years who are currently or forecasted to be separated from a military parent due to a deployment or extended assignment, were recruited from a military pediatric clinic along with their primary caregiver. An intervention was adapted from Bowen and Martin’s (2011) Resiliency Model of Role Performance for Service Members, Veterans, and their Families to identify and improve individual assets and family communication skills, find support through social connections, and prepare for potential stressors by constructing a Roadmap of Life. The Parental Stress Scale (PSS) and Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) were completed before and after the 4-week intervention along with a final caregiver survey to evaluate the caregiver’s perceptions of From Caring 2 Coping. </p>
<p>Results: Four mothers and eight children completed the program for which Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test compared results from pre- and post PSC-17 surveys from the children showing significant improvement post-intervention (p = 0.017). The post PSC-17 results were compared to post PSS results with Spearman Correlation Coefficient, r = 0.949, that is statistically significant (p = 0.05). From Caring 2 Coping is rated as an effective program by parents in a postintervention survey that is easy to incorporate into daily activities. Parents ranked highest satisfaction through use of the Family Communication Plan and Family Timeline. </p>
<p>Conclusions: From Caring 2 Coping intervention tools improved family communication, use of individual assets and Roadmap of Life coping skills, thereby improving child and caregiver coping response as evidenced by improved PSC-17 and PSS scores. Basing the intervention on the Resiliency Model of Role Performance which has proven successful in the military population, improves the chances for success in this target population.

The implementation of survivorship care plans (SCP) has been recognized by key stakeholders as the solution to transitional uncertainties.<br />In fact, to achieve accreditation by the Commission on Cancer (CoC) cancer centers are required to deliver SCPs to cancer survivors within a year of their treatment completion. Research demonstrates SCP delivery results in significant improvement in patient satisfaction, coordination of care, and survivorship care knowledge. In order to meet CoC standard 3.3 and bring understanding to SCPs function in cancer survivorship care a quality improvement project was initiated within an Arizona cancer center. SCPs were delivered at a survivorship visit to adult breast cancer patients. SCPs affect on survivors’ confidence in cancer self-care knowledge and care satisfaction was evaluated as well as the organization’s adherence to CoC standard 3.3 requirements. Identified survivors were scheduled for a survivorship visit where a SCP was delivered by a oncology provider. Survivors perceived confidence in knowledge and satisfaction was measured using the modified 16-item Confidence in Survivorship Information Questionnaire (CSI). Questionnaires were completed pre and post survivorship visit. A paired t-test analysis was used to evaluate SCP effectiveness. There was an increase in the delivery of SCPs from zero to 57 with an 84 percent SCP delivery from August 2017 to January 2018. Survivors and providers verbalize value in SCPs. No statistical significance was found in the comparison of SCPs affect on survivors’ confidence in cancer self-care knowledge and care satisfaction to that of standard follow-up care; however, when comparing the pre/post questionnaire averages an improvement was noted across the board.The prospect of this project is to unveil the impact SCP delivery at a survivorship visit has on the selected metrics.

<p>Background &amp; Significance: Falls continue to be the leading cause of injury-related deaths of Arizonans who are 65 years or older - well above the national average. It is predicted that by 2030, national medical spending for this population will total over $31 billion, yearly. Tai Chi is revered for being a beneficial form of simple, low-impact exercise, which the CDC endorses for its falls risk reduction benefits.  </p>
<p>Methods: The intervention consisted of 60-minute classes occurring twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants were English-speaking, between 65-85 years old, and able to ambulate independently. Appropriate pre-screening tools were used before applicants consented. Their Fear of Falling (FoF) was measured using a fall risk perception tool at the beginning, middle, and the end of the project. This ordinal data was analyzed with Friedman ANOVA using SPSS 25</p>
<p>Outcomes/Results: After enrolling five total participants, only three completed the project. This severely limited data analysis of their FoF, resulting in a statistical significance (p = 0.68), deeming the intervention ineffective - Despite observable downwards trending FoF scores.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The acceptance of the null hypothesis is attributed to the low enrollment and high attrition rate. Also, the only data measured was quantifiable, subjective data. Future projects could add objective data to reinforce the benefits of Tai Chi. This might reinforce the validity of Tai Chi as a practical recommendation due to its cost-effective simple interventional design and effectiveness for prevention of accidental falls. Increased focus on improved recruitment &amp; retainment strategies should be prioritized for similar projects in the future.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5710,"|Tailored Messaging Feedback to Improve Parent Knowledge and Behavior Practices on Pediatric Drowning Prevention|","<p>Introduction and Background: Drowning is the leading cause of preventable injury death in Arizona for children under five years old. Tailored education has demonstrated efficacy in behavior change and knowledge retention. The purpose of this evidence-based project was to evaluate if tailored education improved knowledge and self-reported behaviors related to pediatric drowning. The Elaboration Likelihood Model provided the framework for this project. </p>
<p>Methods/Experimental Approach: The prospective pilot project was conducted using the Iowa Model of Evidence Based Practice. Parents with children under five years, presenting with low acuity complaints in a pediatric emergency department were approached. A baseline assessment identified high-risk behaviors and a custom education plan was delivered to parents.  Outcome variables were measured at baseline and three weeks after initial assessment.  </p>
<p>Results: The average parent age was 29 (M = 28.5; SD = 6.35) years.  Participant (n=29) responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Participants (n = 27, 93%) reported likelihood to change behaviors and 29 (100%) perceived the tailored intervention as relevant.  Secondary outcome variables were not measured at three weeks due to a lack of survey response. </p>
<p>Conclusions: Parents reported a high likelihood of behavior change when water safety education was tailored and relevant to their child.  The tailored intervention evoked positive interaction and receptivity from parents and suggested a high motivation to make a behavior change. The effect of the intervention could not be tested due to the lack of follow-up and post data collection.  The design of this evidence-based project is quantifiable and replicable in a low-acuity setting, which allows for future evaluations of self-reported behavior change and knowledge improvement.

5711,"|Team-Based Care in the Management of Type 2 Diabetes with Consideration for Social Determinants of Health|","<p>The reactionary nature of the current healthcare delivery system in the United States has led to increased healthcare spending from acute exacerbations of chronic disease and unnecessary hospitalizations. Those who suffer from chronic diseases are particularly at risk. The dynamics of health care must include grappling with the complexities of where and how people live and attempt to manage their health and disease. Team-based care may offer a solution due to its interdisciplinary focus on proactive, preventative care delivered in outpatient primary care. Studies examining the effects of team-based care have shown improvement in; HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, healthcare team morale, patient satisfaction rates, quality of care, and patient empowerment. In an effort to improve type 2 diabetes health outcomes and patient satisfaction a team based care project was implemented. The setting was an outpatient primary care clinic where the patients are known to have limited social resources. The healthcare team was comprised of a DNP Student, Master of Social Work Student, Clinical Pharmacist, and Primary Care Physician, who discussed patient specifics during informal meetings and referral processes. Adult patients whose HbA1c level was greater than 6.5% were eligible to participate, 183 were identified and invited. Fourteen (14) agreed to participate and seven (7) completed the initial screening with a mean HbA1c of 9.7%. Significant social needs were identified using the Health Leads Questionnaire. The diabetes and social needs were addressed by members of the team<br />who met individually with patients monthly over the course of three months. Of those who<br />completed the initial evaluation only two (2) returned for a follow-up and had a repeat HbA1c.</p>
<p>Both participants had important improvements in their A1C with a decrease of 2.3%, and 3.4%.<br />The others were lost to follow up for unknown reasons. Despite the small numbers of<br />participants this project suggests that patients can benefit when an interdisciplinary team<br />addresses their needs and this could improve health outcomes.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5712,"The|Effect of Post Partum Breastfeeding Peer Support on Breastfeeding Success Outcomes|","<p>The health benefits of breastfeeding are well documented and exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months of life is the target of national and global health care organizations. Although initial breastfeeding is on the rise, the percentage of infants still breastfeeding at six months drops significantly. In the population of newly delivered mothers of an obstetric practice, there is no readily accessible breastfeeding support offered following hospital discharge. A review of relevant literature revealed that lack of support is often cited as a key factor in the discontinuation of breastfeeding, whereas the evidence shows that participation in peer support has a positive effect on breastfeeding self-efficacy, which can have a positive effect on breastfeeding duration. To address this problem, the initiation of a breastfeeding closed social network Facebook group for this practice setting population was developed and implemented to provide readily accessible peer support and have a positive effect on the outcome of breastfeeding self-efficacy. Three months after initiation of the Facebook group, an anonymous voluntary survey was offered to group members, and 25 members participated in the survey. Responses demonstrated that peer support is helpful with breastfeeding confidence and that, following participation in the group, the respondents wanted to continue breastfeeding.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

<p>Study Design: Ten health care providers from Vaccines for Children (VFC) clinics in New Mexico were included in this pretest/posttest study. Providers were given a questionnaire adapted from the Determinants of Intent to Vaccinate (DIVA) questionnaire. Only two subscales were utilized for this project (total of 10 items): Adaptation to the Patient’s Profile and General Practitioner’s Commitment to the Vaccine Approach. Martinez et al. (2016) suggest that PCP’s commitment to the vaccination approach” can be used as a stand-alone tool with a Cronbach’s alpha &gt; .70. Following the pretest, which served as consent, providers viewed a short, four video series addressing common barriers to the HPV vaccine, followed by the same questionnaire. First and second dose rates of the HPV vaccine were measured prior to the intervention and three months post intervention using the New Mexico Immunization Information System (NMSIIS).</p>
<p>Results: A Wilcoxon Ranks test was used for statistical analysis of the survey responses. Alpha was set at ≤ .10. Four of the 10 questions were statistically significant for increasing provider intent to vaccinate. HPV first dose rates increased in all three clinics and second dose rates increased in two out of the three clinics.</p>

5714,"The|Effects of mindfulness on Depression and Anxiety|","<p>Depression and anxiety are common and debilitating illnesses that negatively impact personal well-being and functioning. The effects of depression and anxiety not only affect the individual, but also peers, family, the community, economy, and even the health care system. Pharmacological therapy is a first line treatment for depression and anxiety, but the risk for relapse remains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) are treatments that have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. The evidence suggests that both therapies are successful in terms of reducing depressive symptoms, but most effective when combined. Further, evidence shows that the combination of MBCT and traditional pharmacological therapy provides relief from depressive symptoms and lengthens the amount of time between recurrent episodes and improves the quality of life. A project was implemented at an integrated health clinic to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results revealed that practicing mindfulness was statistically and clinically significant in reducing depression and anxiety. In addition, mindfulness scores increased over 30 day application of the intervention. The results demonstrated the value of utilizing mindfulness as a cost-effective therapy in addition to pharmacological treatment to decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improve mindfulness. The ease of use demonstrated the value of mindfulness and self-directed skills aimed at improving wellness, reducing depression and anxiety which will result in the improvement of individual, economic, healthcare system, and community health.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5715,"The|Impact of a Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Best Practice Alert|","<p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most commonly spread sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Although the HPV vaccine protects against transmission of the most common strains of HPV that cause genital warts and numerous urogenital cancers, uptake in the United States remains suboptimal. Failure to vaccinate leaves individuals vulnerable to the virus and subsequent complications of transmission. The evidence demonstrates that provider recommendation alone increases rates of vaccine uptake. The literature does not suggest a specific method for provider recommendation delivery; however, best practice alerts (BPAs) were correlated with increased vaccination rates. These findings have directed a proposed project that includes an electronic health record (EHR) change prompting internal medicine, family practice and women’s health providers to educate and recommend the HPV vaccine at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in the Southwest United States. The project demonstrates that after the implementation of a practice change of a HPV BPA in the EHR, HPV vaccination rates increased. Practice settings pre and post were similar, making the increase clinically significant. The strengths of this project include an increase in HPV vaccination rates, a sustainable intervention, and an intervention that can easily be replicated into other health maintenance tasks. There were some limitations including the BPA alert only catching the HPV 9 vaccine series and the BPA did not always capturing historical data. Despite these technical barriers the HPV BPA delivered an increase in the HPV vaccine to protect more individuals from the HPV virus, increased provider adherence to national guidelines, and provides a platform for BPAs to be utilized for other vaccines.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

The objectives of this clinical intervention were twofold; the implementation of an innovative change within an organization, allowing for systematic screening through incorporation of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), and evaluation of mental health provider’s willingness to incorporate practice change. A pre and post quasi-experimental design evaluated the attitude of providers regarding practice change using the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale and the utilization of the MDQ following educational intervention. Parametric testing was used to explore the relationship between education specific to practice change and the provider's attitude through the use of the paired t test. The Chi-square test evaluated the use of the MDQ by clinic healthcare providers in relation to an innovative practice change. Results of this study illustrate enhanced provider willingness to adopt innovation and increased MDQ use following the intervention.

Nearly three million individuals are affected annually, killing one in every two to four individuals. Sepsis mortality rates are highest in those 65 and older, making it the most expensive diagnosis paid by Medicare and worldwide at $24 billion dollars.

<p>Purpose: This project sought to evaluate the gap that exists between best practice and current practice, for sepsis identification and EGDT implementation.</p>
<p>Methods: The project was completed over a four-month period with prior Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and consisted of evaluation of sepsis knowledge and barriers to EGDT. Questionnaires included demographics, sepsis knowledge, barriers to EGDT and AHRQ quality indicators toolkit.</p>
<p>Results: Sample (N=16) included registered nurses (RN) and healthcare providers. Descriptive statistics were utilized for evaluation of questionnaires. Results indicate staff have sound understanding of signs and symptoms of sepsis, however application through case studies demonstrated lower performance. Overall system barriers were minimal, with greatest barriers in central line monitoring and staff shortages.

5720,"The|Role of Sponsorship and Relapse Prevention|","<p>Background and Aims: The aim of this research was to assess whether clients receiving treatment for substance abuse in a residential treatment facility will achieve lower rates of relapse with treatment in combination with active sponsorship. Prior studies suggest sponsorship may equally be impactful as attending 12-step meetings. </p>
<p>Design: The primary hypothesis was that active participation as defined by contact with a sponsor of an hour or more per week, as measured by the impact on affective characteristics correlated with increased levels of sobriety, when measured by the AWARE questionnaire (Advance Warning of Relapse) within 7 days of entry and prior to discharge (within 30 days). Setting: The project took place in a residential treatment facility in Phoenix, Arizona. </p>
<p>Participants: There were 12 clients from a men’s house and 12 clients from a woman’s house, all of which were going through recovery. Intervention: The educational session explained what a sponsor is and the importance of finding one early as a key role in relapse prevention. </p>
<p>Measurements: Pre and post-test results were compared to see if there was an impact on the predictability of relapse and sponsorship. The paired t-test was performed to compare the two means of AWARE scores. A lower score on the AWARE questionnaire indicates a person is more likely to succeed in sobriety. </p>
<p>Findings: Based on 24 samples collected, the mean scores within the first seven days were 91.17 with a standard deviation of 18.59 and the mean score prior to discharge were 72.78 with a standard deviation (SD) of 20.02. The mean difference between the two scores was 18.39 (SD=2.84). There was a significant effect of the relapse prevention program which included sponsorship, t (22) = 4.79, p &lt; 0.001. </p>

5721,"|Transitional Care Workflow Redesign|","<p>Background and Purpose: Readmission rates for those with chronic conditions are exceeding benchmarks and driving up healthcare spending; there is a need to improve care coordination and outcomes. This project was done to evaluate and offer evidence-based suggestions for improvement to a multidisciplinary care coordination team in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO). Internal data suggests the team is underutilized within the ACO and that the ACO is underperforming. Conscious workflow design has been shown to improve the efficiency of existing work processes.</p>
<p>Methods: The care coordination team (N=6), licensed practical nurses and social workers, were the project participants. Following Institutional Review Board approval, a presentation was given on current ACO performance data and project goals. Team members were invited to participate by filling out a survey. The 31-item Team Development Measure (Cronbach’s α) assessed team functioning to identify where gaps exist in the team’s processes. Further knowledge about workflow was gained via quality improvement methods of direct observation and informal conversational interviews with team members, the ACO team manager, and various providers within the ACO and their staff. Field notes were analyzed and confirmed with the ACO team manager. Rasch analysis was performed on survey data to convert ordinal numeric results from the Likert scale into an interval score from 0 to 100, which correlates with elements of team development.</p>
<p>Results: Rasch analysis revealed a mean score of 54.17 (SD=8.06). Based on this score, the team has cohesiveness and communication in place but has not yet established role and goal clarity. Analysis of notes and impressions revealed a lack of adherence to date deadlines, inconsistent processes among team members, and use of non-evidence based patient care interventions such as minimal to no home visits and a lack of standardized patient education. Team analysis results, workflow observations, and current evidence on transitional care were integrated into an executive report containing realistic prioritized changes that maximize team member’s skill sets and clarify roles and goals of the team which was provided to the ACO administration along with recommendations for evidence-based process improvements.</p>
<p>Conclusion: This project can serve as a model for analyzing team functioning and workflow to inform agencies where gaps in their processes are affecting performance. The analysis can then be used to recommend evidence based practice changes. Implementation of the suggested workflow should improve existing efforts in trying to meet benchmark quality measures for the ACO as well as improve team functioning.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

<p>Methods: Patients who had not previously undergone radiation treatments were identified based on chart review and consented for participation in the project. The patient's were assessed for both their general (trait) anxiety and situational (state) anxiety using The State Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI). They were then shown a virtual reality video that walked them through what they would experience during their radiation treatment. The patient's were re-administered the STAI questionnaire following the video to assess any change in anxiety levels.</p>
<p>Variables: Trait and State anxiety scores before and after the virtual reality video intervention.</p>
<p>Findings/Outcomes: A paired t-test was conducted to assess the data. There was a significant difference in the state anxiety scores pre intervention (m = 32.65, SD = 11.47) and post intervention (M = 25.50, SD 8.95), p =&lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The use of virtual reality videos was an effective non-pharmacological approach to reduce anxiety in patients receiving radiation treatment.</p>
<p>Implications for nursing: The results provide support for the use of a virtual reality intervention as a non-pharmacologic option to reduce anxiety for patients.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5723,"|Using a Clinical Guideline Coupled with Education to Improve Healthcare Providers&#039; Knowledge of Early Sepsis Recognition in the Post-Acute Care Setting|A Quality Improvement Project","<p>Aims: The goals of this project were (1) develop a sepsis clinical guideline, (2) enhance direct patient care staff knowledge of sepsis and (3) survey staff comfort level with identifying sepsis post intervention.</p>
<p>Background: Sepsis remains a significant healthcare problem associated with high treatment costs and high mortality rates. Older adults are at an increased risk for developing sepsis, especially when age is combined with any type of compromising factor, such as chronic illness, recent hospitalizations, wounds, or invasive devices. Current evidence demonstrates that sepsis screening is effective for early identification of sepsis. Early identification of sepsis improves time to treatment initiation, which improves outcomes.</p>
<p>Methods: An evidence-based, provider approved clinical guideline was developed for a post-acute care facility after an extensive review of the literature. Upon implementation, brief educational sessions were provided to direct patient care staff. Participants completed pre- and post-tests as well as a demographic survey. A satisfaction survey was administered 30 days post intervention. A paired samples t-test was used to analyze the difference in test scores. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationship between staff comfort levels and the clinical guideline.</p>
<p>Results: The samples included 25 participants in the educational intervention and 18 in the satisfaction survey. There was a significant difference in the scores between pre-test (M = 72.3, SD = 12.43) and post-test scores (M = 86.6, SD = 10.2); t(24) = -5.578, p &lt; 0.001. There was a significant correlation between staff who felt comfortable in identifying sepsis with ease of screening (r = .831, p &lt; .01) and high comfort levels with the policy (r = .889, p &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Utilizing a clinical guideline, coupled with education, improves staff knowledge and comfort identifying sepsis in the post-acute care setting, which may improve early recognition and treatment initiation. This outcome is clinically significant as patients in this setting represent a vulnerable population.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5724,"|Using Teach Back to Evaluate the Efficacy of a Pediatric Headache Program|A DNP Project","<p>Background: Only 40%-80% of health information is retained during an office visit due to ineffective communication. Caregivers, and patients, are unable to remember how to manage their health care needs. Teach back is an effective tool that encourages a conversation between the caregiver/patient and provider. The purpose of this project is to increase knowledge retention and self-management behaviors using a headache teach back tool.</p>
<p>Methods: The quality department at a large children’s hospital in the southwestern United States approved the project as a practice change and parent consent was not required. The project design was a randomized controlled group: pretest-posttest design, quality improvement method. Participants were chosen by convenience sample. Required diagnoses were headache or migraine. Each group had 18 participants, for a total of 36 participants. Ages ranged from four to 18 years of age, with legal guardians present for the intervention group only. New and follow-up patients were included in the project. Demographics for each group were statistically similar. Questionnaires were used to assess knowledge pre and post implementation of teach back tool. Self-management was measured by a follow-up phone call after their appointment to inquire regarding implementation of the headache diary. Charts were reviewed for both groups regarding the number and type of phone calls received by the office. </p>
<p>Outcomes: Paired sample t-test was used to evaluate mean differences in knowledge from pre and post questions of teach back tool. Data analysis concluded a statistical increase in knowledge of triggers and prevention techniques. Cohen’s d for triggers was 2.21 and 1.87 for prevention. Self-management of behavior was measured by use of headache diary and determined by a percentage. Sixty-seven individuals started to use the headache diary. Independent t-test was used to compare number of phone calls from each group. Data concluded a decrease in phone calls. However, due to a small sample size, statistical significance could not be established. </p>
<p>Conclusion: Teach back encourages caregiver/patient and provider interaction, which increases health literacy retention and increases self-management behaviors. Future research should focus on patients with headaches with unknown triggers for their headaches.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5725,"|Using Wearable Technology to Increase Daily Activity|A Weight and Wellness Program Initiative","<p>Purpose: To assess study participants behavioral responses and perception of effectiveness of an activity tracking device to increase physical activity. Obesity is an endemic health issue in the U.S. and continues to gain concern for increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Benefits of physical activity are firmly established across healthcare disciplines to combat and prevent obesity, yet sedentary behaviors continue to be on the rise. The use of wearable technology, that provides real-time feedback of activity, has been identified as a promising tool for increasing physical activity.</p>
<p>Methods: Analysis of a subset of questions from a larger survey was used to evaluate wearable device attitudes and behavior changes over time. Convenience sample (n=10), ages &gt;18, required enrollment in a clinic-based weight and wellness program (WWP) to participate. The survey questions assessed effectiveness of wearable device on a 0-10 motivation scale to increase physical activity and a self- assessment of behavioral changes at specific intervals over a 6-month period. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric, two-tailed tests will be used to analyze the data. Due to the necessity of detecting minute differences with the small sample size, the significance level will be tested at the p&lt;0.10.</p>
<p>Results: Participants &gt;18 years of age, enrolled in a WWP (n=10) included 20% male and 80% female. Although a 12.3% increase in the mean score was found from week-1 to 6-months, the results were not statistically conclusive to the effectiveness of self-motivation to increase activity by participants wearing an activity tracking device; however, results are statistically significant for participants to increase activity with behavior changes based on device dashboard.</p>
<p>Conclusions: It is recommended for primary care providers to encourage the use of an activity tracking wearable device for behavior change to increase activity.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5727,"|Utilizing Technology to Affect Influenza Vaccine Coverage Among Children with Chronic Respiratory Conditions|","<p>Purpose: To integrate text messaging into a multi-component reminder system to improve influenza vaccination rates among children with chronic respiratory conditions.</p>
<p>Background:  Influenza presents burdens for children with chronic respiratory conditions including increased mortality, morbidity, hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life for children and caregivers. Influenza vaccinations may reduce these complications yet approximately half of children remain unprotected annually.   Synthesized evidence supports integration of text messaging into a multi-component strategy to increase the influenza vaccination rate in many populations of interest. </p>
<p>Methods:  The intervention was a single text message and electronic mail message sent to all families in a private pediatric pulmonology practice who enabled text and/or electronic mail messages in the patient portal.  A follow-up survey assessed various aspects of message receipt.  Surveys were completed without collection of demographic information.</p>
<p>Results:  Electronic mail messages were sent to 3140 addresses available in the patient portal.  The number of text messages sent out via the patient portal was 75 with 66 (88%) delivered successfully.  Follow-up surveys were initiated by 107 recipients.  Frequency analysis showed that participants preferred text and electronic mail messages over other forms of communication. A statistically significant positive relationship was found utilizing Chi Square between those who received a message and those whose child received an influenza vaccination (p= .027).</p>
<p>Conclusions:  Text and electronic mail messaging are cost-effective and well-received forms of communication that can be easily integrated into existing systems.  These delivery routes are translatable to many populations and can convey various types of messages.</p>",,"Arizona State University.
