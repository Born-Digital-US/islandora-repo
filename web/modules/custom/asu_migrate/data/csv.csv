5604,"A:Depression Care Management Intervention for Home Health Nurses:","<p>Purpose: To examine the implementation of a web-based depression care management training program to increase home health nurses’ knowledge and attitudes regarding depression.<br />
Background and Significance: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2015 that the incidence of major depression in elderly receiving home health service rose to 13.5% compared to less than 5% with those not receiving care in the community.<br />
Materials and Methods: An intervention program was offered to a convenience sample of home health nurses caring for elderly in the community. The Depression CARE for Patients AT Home (depression CAREPATH), which is an evidenced-based online training program consisting of didactic resources about depression screening and depression care management and e-learning modules. Participants were given a pre and post survey to assess their knowledge of the material. Additionally demographic information was obtained via self-report.<br />
Results: A total of 8 out of 18 home health nurses participated in the study. All were females; 13% Caucasian and 88% were Asian. There’s an average of 37 years old (SD 14.7, range 23-58) and had 3 years of experience (SD 2.07, range &lt;1-6). The mean depression CAREPATH knowledge total pre-test score was 15 (SD 1.85, range 13-18), while the mean total post-test score was 18.13 (SD 0.99, range 17-19). There was a difference in the depression knowledge test scores at baseline. All the participants obtained a passing score for the post-test (80%). The mean R-DAQ total pre-test score was 71 (SD 13.37, range 53-71) and mean total post-test score was 68, (SD 3.48, range 62-70). The professional confidence in depression attitude indicated agreement post intervention, except with the feeling comfortable in working with physical illness<br />than mental illness (pre intervention 62.5%, post intervention 100%). Participants agreed that home health nurses are well placed and more confident in assisting patients with depression (pre Depression Care Management 3 3 intervention 75%, post intervention 100%). In addition, participants felt more confident in<br />assessing suicide risk post intervention in patient s presenting with depression. Based from Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test, there was a statistical difference, z = -2.536, p= .01, between the depression knowledge pre and post-test scores, which indicates that there is an increase in depression knowledge after the intervention. However, there was no significant difference, z = -.846, p = .397 between the depression attitude, which indicate that there is no change in depression attitude after the intervention.<br />
Conclusion: For this sample depression knowledge was increased post intervention, however, increase in knowledge did not significantly alter the depression attitude. Further study in a larger more diverse sample is needed for this intervention.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5605,"A:Quality Improvement Project Implementing PrEP Academic Detailing to Impact Provider Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior in a Primary Care Setting:","<p>Background: In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug emtricitabine/tenofovir for use as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) after proving to be safe and effective at preventing HIV in multiple peer-reviewed studies. Despite the proven safety and value of PrEP treatment, use remains low in practice. Research has shown that low clinical use corresponds to low levels of understanding of PrEP among providers. Academic detailing is a method of innovation diffusion through provider education that results in changes in knowledge and practice. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of academic detailing on primary care provider knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to prescribe PrEP.<br />
Methods: An academic detailing session was provided by the Florida Department of Health in Broward County to primary care providers (PCPs) at a private clinic in the Southeastern US. The Conceptual Model of Nursing and Population Health (CMNPH) and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services Framework (PARIHS) were used as guides for project design and evidence-based practice implementation. There were five participants in the academic detailing session including: a physician, a physician assistant (PA), and three medical students. PCP PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured using pre and post intervention surveys. PrEP prescription, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) screening, and HIV testing were measured using aggregate data queries for the time periods of four and eight weeks before and four and eight weeks after the educational intervention. No personal identifying information was obtained.<br />
Results: Pre and post surveys were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank testing to examine differences between matched pairs of ordinal data. Significant PrEP screening and HIV/STI testing were analyzed pre and post intervention using paired t tests to compare pre and post intervention practices. Significant differences were found in the results (Z = 2.03, 1.84, and 1.83 respectively, p &gt; 0.1) The academic detailing intervention significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers and medical students regarding PrEP. The mean of active qualifying ICD 10 codes prior to the intervention versus post intervention were 5 (sd = 5.64) vs. 4.2 (sd = 4.87) respectively. No significant difference was found between active ICD 10 codes for patient visits before compared to after the intervention (t (9) = 1.12, p&gt;.1).<br />
Conclusions: This project found that academic detailing improved provider self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding PrEP. However, self-reported survey scores were not correlated with changes in clinical practice based on ICD 10 codes. Additional clinical implications may include fostering clinical outreach and cooperation between the county health department and local primary care clinics. Further research is needed on the effects of PrEP academic detailing on clinical practice.</p>",,"Arizona State University.

5603,"A:culturally competent behavioral weight loss program for adult Latinos with a BMI &amp;gt;30kg/m2:","<p>This study answers the question, “In Adult Hispanic BMI ≥ 30 (P), how does development of a weight loss program that utilizes Motivational Interviewing (I) compared to counseling and educational materials only (C) affect weight loss over the period of three months (T).” There are limited published systematic reviews and randomized control trials to evaluate the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI), in conjunction with diet and exercise to promote weight loss. Participants (n = 5) were Latino patients of a local community health care center who were overweight and medically at risk due to unhealthy lifestyles that were determined through a screening test. The 4-week clinical pathway program used motivational interviewing in one-on-one sessions every other week, and implemented the “Your Heart, Your Life” curriculum the other weeks. One expected outcome included lower anthropometric measurement numbers of participants’ WL, BMI, WC, and BP. Another expected outcome was an increase in physical activity. Participants were also expected to earn a higher score on a post-test about nutrition and healthy living. A paired t-test and power analyses were used to assess its effectiveness. Results indicated significant decrease in weight loss (t [5] = 3.68, p = .0211, Cohen’s dz=1.647). For heart healthy habits, there were significant increases all three categories: weight management (t [5] = - 3.36, p = .0211), cholesterol and fat (t [5] = - 3.138, p =.035, salt and sodium (t [5] = - 4.899, p = .008). In addition, there was an increase in knowledge (t [5] = - 4.000, p = .016). Every participant showed small gains. Future implications should include more participants, including males, a control group, innovative activities that help to motivate a community of learners and more flexibility in allotted time for interventions.</p>",,"Arizona State University.
