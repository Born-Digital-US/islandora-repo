Michael (Author)",,2009,"The static, fragmentary archaeological record requires us to construct models of the human past. Traditionally, these have been narratives that make compelling stories but are difficult to evaluate. Recent advances in geospatial and agent-based modeling technology offers the potential to create quantitative models of human systems, but also challenge us to conceive of human societies in ways that can be expressed in algorithmic form. Besides making our own explanations more robust, integrating such quantitative modeling into archaeological practice can produce more useful accounts of human systems and their long-term dynamics for other disciplines and policy makers.|abstract",eng,,,Text,26 Pages,,"Invited Plenary Session paper presented at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Atlanta, GA.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0,Public,,2012-12-17 18:06:51.626545+00:00,2018-06-21 18:47:49.309102+00:00,1,,,15645.0,"Barton, C.

24,5,Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics Project,Composing Hybrid Discrete Event System and Cellular Automata Models,15563,,"Mayer, G. R. (Author)",,2009-08,"Hybrid system models - those devised from two or more disparate sub-system
models - provide a number of benefits in terms of conceptualization, development, and
assessment of dynamical systems. The decomposition approach helps to formulate complex
interactions that are otherwise difficult or impractical to express. However, hybrid model de-
velopment and usage can introduce complexity that emerges from the composition itself. To
improve assurance of model correctness, sub-systems using disparate modeling formalisms
must be integrated above and beyond just the data and control level; their composition
must have model specification and simulation execution aspects as well. Poly-formalism
composition is one approach to composing models in this manner.
This dissertation describes a poly-formalism composition between a Discrete EVent
System specification (DEVS) model and a Cellular Automata (CA) model types. These
model specifications have been chosen for their broad applicability in important and emerg-
ing domains. An agent-environment domain exemplifies the composition approach. The
inherent spatial relations within a CA make it well-suited for environmental representa-
tions. Similarly, the component-based nature of agents fits well within the hierarchical
component structure of DEVS. This composition employs the use of a third model, called
an interaction model, that includes methods for integrating the two model types at a for-
malism level, at a systems architecture level, and at a model execution level. A prototype
framework using DEVS for the agent model and GRASS for the environment has been de-
veloped and is described. Furthermore, this dissertation explains how the concepts of this
composition approach are being applied to a real-world research project.
This dissertation expands the tool set modelers in computer science and other disci-
plines have in order to build hybrid system models, and provides an interaction model for an
on-going research project. The concepts and models presented in this dissertation demon-
strate the feasibility of composition between discrete-event agents and discrete-time cellular
automata. Furthermore, it provides concepts and models that may be applied directly, or
used by a modeler to devise compositions for other research efforts.|abstract",eng,9781109333077|ISBN,,Text,152 Pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0,Public,,2012-11-30 16:57:05.792056+00:00,2018-06-21 18:47:49.174290+00:00,1,,,15563.0,,"Mayer, Gary R.",,,,,Composing Hybrid Discrete Event System and Cellular Automata Models,,,Land use|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85074345,Human ecology|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85062856,Neolithic period|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85090768,Geographic information systems|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2003007733,Mediterranean Region|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85083230,Faculty scholarship,,,Land use|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85074345||Human ecology|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85062856||Neolithic period|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85090768||Geographic information systems|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2003007733,"Mayer, Gary R.",

settlement systems and attempts to explain how social, economic and political
adjustments helped tribal groups survive under natural (i.e., climatic) and anthropogenic
(i.e., land degradation, erosion) stress factors. The shifting of subsistence base from
agropastoral to pastoral their reflections in site and population densities, diversity of site
types, levels of internal complexity and levels of social organization via the presence of
large settlements, like villages, which acted as economic and administrative centers
emerge as risk reduction mechanisms. The cycles of abandonment and resettlement are
evaluated within the concept of social reorganization and such changes are assessed as
parts of economic revitalization attempts. The social changes that emerge from such
shifts are evaluated from the perspective of the scale-free networks model and tested
through statistical methods, such as ANOVA, for spatial and temporal patterns while
patterns of land use and the impacts of changing climate and anthropogenic activities are
evaluated with GIS. Following the dimorphic society and heterarchic social organization
concepts, the discussion emphasizes that tribal groups adjust population density, range
and intensity of activities in marginal landscapes, like the Hasa, in order to prevent
environmental degradation. These patterns may change once these marginal landscapes
are integrated to more complex social organizations. Although this takes place in the
Hasa during the Iron Age, the research results imply that environmental degradation did
not take place possibly due to the continuation of extensive subsistence patterns, along
with the emergence of the long-distance caravan trade as a major economic incentive.|abstract",eng,1124261311|ISBN,,Text,345 Pages,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0,Public,,2012-11-30 16:43:45.518297+00:00,2018-06-21 18:47:49.162126+00:00,1,,,15562.0,,"Arikan, Bulent",,,,,Reorganization and Risk: Environmental Change and Tribal Land Use in Marginal Landscapes of Southern Jordan,Abstract not formated correctly,,Paleoclimatology|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85097057,Social ecology|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh92004049,,,,Faculty scholarship,,,Paleoclimatology|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85097057||Social ecology|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh92004049,"Arikan, Bulent",

N. (Author) || La Rocca, N. (Author) || Arrowsmith, J. Ramon (Author) || Diez-Castillo, A. (Author) || Bernabeu, J. (Author) || Barton, C. Michael (Author)",,,"Dramatic changes in land use were associated with the rise of agriculture in the mid Holocene in the Mediterranean region. Both the surface properties and the drainage networks were changed. Along with the direct modifications to surface properties (vegetation removal and change, sediment liberation and compaction) and consequent drainage alteration (terracing, canals), up and downstream responses in the watersheds communicated these changes throughout the landscape. The magnitude, rate, and feedbacks with the growing human populations are critical questions in our effort to assess human-landscape interactions. To investigate these relationships, recent field work in the Penaguila Valley in southeast Spain included landform mapping, alluvial deposit description, and sample collection emphasizing areas of active erosion, remnant land surfaces and their relation to archaeological sites. We have updated our geomorphic maps by refining the delineation of alluvial terraces, steep-walled (40m deep) drainages (""barrancos""), and hollows (""barrancos de fondo plano""). Hollows are curved, elongate, flat-bottomed gullies with steep walls (2-30m tall) and extend headward from the main barrancos. This work enables more accurate terrace correlations necessary for both landscape evolution modeling and interpretation of the development history of the basin. Alluvial terraces are crucial to this research because they record periods of past stable topography. In the Penaguila, sites dating back to late Mesolithic and early Neolithic (around 6600 BP) and subsequent periods (Chalcolithic and Bronze Age) are exposed on a prominent terrace surface mapped as Terrace A. This broad low relief surface is scarred by deep barrancos and hollow formation that expose bedrock marls and overlying alluvial deposits. Stratigraphic profiles and texture analyses of Terrace A deposits reveal overland flow facies and channel networks in reworked and CaCO3-encrusted marls, and several organic-rich paleosols. Small remnant surfaces mapped as Terrace Z (below Terrace A) were observed within the main barrancos and indicate a later, brief accumulation period with subsequent incision to the modern channel. Holocene landscape development in the Penaguila appears to have progressed from a period of stability to slope denudation with aggradation (stream infilling) followed by rapid incision which initiated sometime near the time of occupation. This change from a low relief alluvial surface to one cut by narrow channels may have been an important shift for local populations. Their response to that environmental modification may be associated with the horticulturalist to agricultural intensification noted in the archaeological record. Tighter chronology and better understanding of the driving processes for barranco incision and hollow formation will improve our ability to correlate the changing landscape with land use practices. Such an improved correlation leads to better understanding of human-landscape interactions.|",eng,,,Text,,,Conference Poster,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Public,,2011-06-07 22:43:01.437613+00:00,2018-06-21 21:58:08.279786+00:00,1,,,8333.0,,"DiMaggio, E.
