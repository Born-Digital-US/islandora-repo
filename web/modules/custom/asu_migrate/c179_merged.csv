0,179.0,Kevin Pardon's Collection,Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work,43346.0,Digital Repositories || DNP Final Projects || Student Scholarship || Doctor of Nursing Practice || Collaboration,,2017-05-30,"Objectives: While PhD dissertations are typically accessible as part of a university library’s general collection, or as content within a proprietary database, many other terminal degree projects remain invisible and inaccessible to a greater audience. This poster will describe the development and creation of a digital repository collection containing doctor of nursing practice (DNP) student’s final projects.<br/><br/>Methods: The “Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Final Projects Collection” was created over the course of one semester and included initial discussions with program faculty and administrators, the creation of a student consent form, the development of a process for adding student work to the repository collection, and a presentation to graduating students. This poster will describe the process in more detail, discuss benefits and challenges, as well as highlight the considerations to keep in mind when developing and creating a digital collection of student work.  Additionally, best practices and lessons learned will also be described to provide valuable information to others considering creating this type of collection at their own institution.<br/><br/>Results: At the end of the first semester of implementation, twenty student projects existed in our public collection: https://repository.asu.edu/collections/260.  On the whole, both faculty and students were pleased to have a collection highlighting the work being done in their program.  Valuable lessons were learned that can be applied in the next semester of implementation.  Specifically, metadata consistency was an issue during the initial uploading process.  Gaining select faculty and student buy-in by allaying concerns related to some student’s wanting to publish in a peer-reviewed journal on the topic of their final project remains vital.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Creating open access collections of student applied final projects or capstone projects allows for greater visibility of this type of often overlooked student scholarship.  Specifically, the final projects showcased can now be found and accessed by potential employers, researchers, other schools, and other DNP students. In many cases these final projects have applied real-world impact related to answering clinical questions or patient care that should be shared with the world.",,eng,,MLA Annual Meeting 2017,Mixed Material,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0,Public,,2017-04-26 18:14:27.051133+00:00,2018-06-21 18:47:53.550277+00:00,1.0,kpardon1,,43346.0,,"Pardon, Kevin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student Work,,,Digital libraries|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh95008857,"Dissertations, Academic|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85038494",Academic libraries -- Collection development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Faculty scholarship,,Digital Document,,0,"Digital libraries|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh95008857||Dissertations, Academic|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85038494||Academic libraries -- Collection development",,"Pardon, Kevin",,,,,"[{""model"": ""repo.historicalitem"", ""pk"": 524111, ""fields"": {""id"": 43346, ""created"": ""2017-04-26T18:14:27.051Z"", ""modified"": ""2018-06-21T18:47:53.550Z"", ""handle_registered"": true, ""label"": ""Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work"", ""item_enabled"": true, ""item_status"": 1, ""metadata"": ""{'reuse': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0', 'description': [{'value': 'Objectives: While PhD dissertations are typically accessible as part of a university library\u2019s general collection, or as content within a proprietary database, many other terminal degree projects remain invisible and inaccessible to a greater audience.

In many cases these final projects have applied real-world impact related to answering clinical questions or patient care that should be shared with the world.', 'type': 'abstract'}], 'title': ['Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Pardon', 'rest': 'Kevin', 'roles': ['Bookplate designer']}], 'language': ['eng'], 'created': '2017-05-30', 'rights': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0', 'series': ['MLA Annual Meeting 2017'], 'subject': ['Institutional Repository', 'DNP Final Projects', 'Student Scholarship', 'Doctor of Nursing Practice', 'Collaboration']}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 179, ""history_date"": ""2017-10-11T17:20:29.508Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""~"", ""history_user"": 4130}}, {""model"": ""repo.historicalitem"", ""pk"": 309930, ""fields"": {""id"": 43346, ""created"": ""2017-04-26T18:14:27.051Z"", ""modified"": ""2017-04-26T18:15:01.661Z"", ""handle_registered"": true, ""label"": ""Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work"", ""item_enabled"": true, ""item_status"": 1, ""metadata"": ""{'title': ['Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Pardon', 'rest': 'Kevin'}], 'rights': 'All Rights Reserved'}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 179, ""history_date"": ""2017-04-26T18:15:01.666Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""~"", ""history_user"": null}}, {""model"": ""repo.historicalitem"", ""pk"": 309929, ""fields"": {""id"": 43346, ""created"": ""2017-04-26T18:14:27.051Z"", ""modified"": ""2017-04-26T18:15:00.898Z"", ""handle_registered"": false, ""label"": ""Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work"", ""item_enabled"": true, ""item_status"": 1, ""metadata"": ""{'title': ['Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Pardon', 'rest': 'Kevin'}], 'rights': 'All Rights Reserved'}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 179, ""history_date"": ""2017-04-26T18:15:00.899Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""~"", ""history_user"": 4130}}, {""model"": ""repo.historicalitem"", ""pk"": 309928, ""fields"": {""id"": 43346, ""created"": ""2017-04-26T18:14:27.051Z"", ""modified"": ""2017-04-26T18:14:27.051Z"", ""handle_registered"": false, ""label"": ""Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work"", ""item_enabled"": true, ""item_status"": 2, ""metadata"": ""{'title': ['Developing a Digital Collection of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Student  Work'], 'contributor': [{'last': 'Pardon', 'rest': 'Kevin'}], 'rights': 'All Rights Reserved'}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 179, ""history_date"": ""2017-04-26T18:14:27.094Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": 4130}}]"

Our PDA model of collection development involves purchasing print and e-books when users select them in the online catalog, rather than receiving items on an approval plan or by librarian selection.  After an initial investigation concluded that several major health sciences publications had not been loaded into the catalog for potential patron selection, we began a more thorough examination of our PDA profile.\\nASU serves over 6,500 students, faculty, and staff in Nursing and Allied Health fields in a range of programs requiring a robust collection.  This poster details the process we used to determine whether the profiles created by previous librarians in 2009 have succeeded in uploading records for publications that appear on the 2014 nursing texts from Doody\u2019s Core Titles into our catalog.  Specifically, our poster will present on the number of Doody\u2019s titles that were excluded from the PDA plan due to our profile settings and analyze why these titles were excluded.

5,179.0,Kevin Pardon's Collection,"How Do Google, Google Scholar, and Other Google Tools Help Health Professionals Navigate the Oceans of Information",19123.0,Health Sciences || Research Tools || Google Scholar || Literature Searching,Arizona State University. ASU Library,2013-07-26,"As health information professionals we are familiar with specialized resources such as PubMed and CINAHL but less familiar with general freely available tools such as Google, Google Scholar, and other open Google tools. We wondered: 1) What Google tools are Health Sciences Researchers and Healthcare Professionals using, and how are they using them? 2) How effective are Google and/or Google Scholar for literature searching? 3) What other research is needed in this area?<br/>Methods<br/>We searched for: ‘google’ across five health sciences and health sciences related databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycInfo, PubMed, Web of Science) and in Google Scholar (*For Google Scholar we searched: health AND google). We reviewed the first 100 citations from each database and selected results that: 1) Mentioned use of a Google tool, or 2) Discussed the effectiveness of Google or Google Scholar in scholarly literature searching. Out of the second group, we selected and read the 10 most relevant articles discussing the effectiveness of Google and/or Google Scholar for literature searching. We tried out recommended best practices to search for topics we had previously searched only in subject specific databases.<br/>Results<br/>Health Sciences Researchers and Healthcare Professionals use many Google tools for a variety of purposes. Each tool was used in different ways by authors writing in the Health Sciences (see pie charts and examples in poster). Regarding literature searching the poster includes Google Scholar content sources, Top Search Strategies for Google Scholar, and Considerations for using Google Scholar for literature searching.<br/>Conclusions<br/>Health Science researchers use a variety of Google tools to gather and manipulate data, and to visualize and disseminate results. Health care professionals use Google tools to facilitate interventions and for interactive educational materials. For Literature searching our results encourage using Google Scholar to complement subject specific databases.
