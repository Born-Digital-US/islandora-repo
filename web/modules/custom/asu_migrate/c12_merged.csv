The library consistently receives a large number of requests to add new e-resources to its collection. At the same time, the library is experiencing a downward pressure on its collection budget due to the current recession in general and in the State of Arizona in particular. This has resulted in an increase in the evaluation and monitoring of the use of e-resources.
