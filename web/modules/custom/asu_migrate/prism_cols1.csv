About the collection: Joyce Finch, a faculty member in the ASU College of Nursing, interviewed twenty-six World War II-era women trained as nurses at accredited nursing schools for the Cadet Nurses Project, also known as the “Victory Nurse Corps.” The program was supervised by the United States Public Health Service during World War II. As the war progressed, the demand for nurses increased dramatically, creating a nursing shortage. When the Cadet Nurses Project ended, over one thousand nursing schools had participated in the program. This oral history project reveals the contributions of the nurses on the home front who helped win the war for America. They were educated trained nurses, and good ones: proud of their profession, their country, and their work. Copies of the oral history release forms of interviewees for the Cadet Nurses Project accompany each transcript. Signed originals are in the departmental Master Oral History Release Form File.

The photograph-negative collection, the work of Mrs. Mimi Palgen-Maisonneuve, consists of over 1,000 black and white, self-developed Rolleiflex negatives and photographs of village and rural scenes, as well as everyday images of urban lives of the Cambodian people during the period from 1946 to 1962. The collection also contains approximately 500 black and white negatives taken within the Angkor temple complex. The earliest negatives from Angkor contain images taken of temples prior to and during restoration work conducted under French auspices. Later negatives contains images of post-restoration work. In addition, the collection contains approximately 100 slides taken by Dr. and Mrs. Palgen while on assignment in Vietnam in the early 1960s, Indonesia and Thailand in the early 1980s.

The bulk of the photos reflect Cambodian life in this important period in modern Cambodian history. During World War II, France continued to control the country through its Vichy government. In 1946, the Japanese dissolved the colonial administration, and in March King Norodom Sihanouk declared an independent, anti-colonial government under Prime Minister Son Ngoc Thanh. The new government was deposed by the Allies in October of that same year. Although France recognized Cambodia as an autonomous kingdom within the French Union, the drive for total independent continued, which hastened the French government's recognition of Cambodia's full independence on November 9, 1953. During the 1950s and 1960s, the later period during which Mimi Palgen-Maisonneuve was a resident in Cambodia, the country tried to remain neutral as the Indochinese Conflict developed around it. The conflict caused Cambodian culture to be annihilated by the Khmer Rouge.

The collection is also associated with Northern Illinois University as a collaborative project between Arizona State University Libraries and Northern Illinois University Libraries [Southeast Asia Digital Library](http://sea.lib.niu.edu/) aimed at digitizing old photographs taken by Mimi Palgen Maisonneuve in the 1950s and 1960s and photographing the same locations to show contemporary Cambodian life in the year 2007.  [Then and Now: Historical Photographs of Cambodia](http://sea.lib.niu.edu/cambodiaprojects) links the history of Cambodia from the past to the present through photographs and descriptions.

Mrs. Mimi Palgen-Maisonneuve was married to Dr. Jacques O. Palgen, a professor of geodesy and photogrammetry and a former United Nations official. Mimi was a former resident of Cambodia, and a staff member of Radio Cambodge in Phnom-Penh from 1946-1962.",ralph.gabbard@asu.edu,1,1,1,2011-10-07 22:17:38.855146+00:00

3,James Schoenwetter (Faculty) Research Papers,,http://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.C.3,Collection,,"James Schoenwetter joined the ASU Department of Anthropology (now School of Human Evolution and Social Change) faculty in 1967, following four years at the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe, New Mexico, and retired in 2000. His research interests were in the areas of prehistoric cultural ecology, applications of pollen analysis in archaeology, and research methodology.

Prior to retirement, he directed the department's palynology laboratory. Pollen research by Schoenwetter and his students has involved a variety of sites in Mesoamerica, North America and Europe, and continued after his retirement. He directed archaeological and botanical fieldwork in the Midwestern and Southwestern United States, California, Oaxaca, Zacatecas, Jalisco, England and France.

Schoenwetter pioneered study of pollen records from archaeological site-context deposits in the Southwest and Midwest in the 1960’s, identified palynological evidence of Archaic Horizon maize cultivation in Arizona, Illinois and Mexico in the 1970’s, and was among the earliest students of the palynological records of Historic Archaeology site-context deposits. 

This collection of unpublished professional writings have not been edited since they were written between 1958 and 2004. The palynological and archaeological information they contain, and the concepts and methods presented, will prove useful to others researching similar problems and situations. These writings have not been subject to professional peer review and should not be recognized as contributions to published scientific literature.
