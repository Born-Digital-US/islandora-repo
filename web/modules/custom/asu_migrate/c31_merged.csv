0,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,"Quantifying Vehicle Waste Heat: A Case Study of Phoenix, Arizona",46072,,"Hoehne, Christopher (Author)",,2018-01-15,"Mitigation of urban heat islands has become a goal for research and policy as urban environmental heat is a rapidly growing concern. Urban regions such as Phoenix, AZ are facing projected warming as urban populations grow and global climates warm (McCarthy et al. 2010), and severe urban heat can even lead to human mortality and morbidity (Berko et al. 2014). Increased urban heat may also have social and economic consequences such as by discouraging physical activity, reducing outdoor accessibility, and decreasing economic output (Stamatakis et al. 2013; Karner et al. 2015; Obradovich & Fowler 2017; Kjellstrom et al. 2009). Urban heat islands have been well documented in academic literature (Oke 1982; Arnfield 2003), and anthropogenic waste heat is often a major factor. The American Meteorological Society (2012) has said that anthropogenic waste heat may contribute “15 – 50 W/m2 to the local heat balance, and several hundred W/m2 in the center of large cities in cold climates and industrial areas.”<br/><br/>Anthropogenic waste heat from urban vehicle travel may be a notable contributor to the urban heat balance and the urban heat island effect, but little research has quantified and explored how changes in vehicle travel may influence local climates. Even with recent rapid improvements to engine efficiencies, modern automobiles still convert small amounts of fuel to useful energy. Typically, around two-thirds of energy from fuel in internal combustion engine vehicles is lost as waste heat through exhaust and coolant (Hsiao et al. 2010; Yu & Chau 2009; Saidur et al. 2009; Endo et al. 2007), and as much as 80% of fuel energy can be lost to waste heat under poor conditions (Orr et al. 2016). In addition, combustion of fuel generates water vapor and air pollution which may also affect the urban climate. Figure 1 displays where a typical combustion engine’s fuel energy is used and lost. There has been little research that quantifies the influence of vehicle travel on urban anthropogenic waste heat. According to Sailor and Lu (2004), most cities have peak anthropogenic waste heat values between 30 and 60 W m-2 (averaged across city) and heating from vehicles could make up as much as 62% of the total in summer months. Additionally, they found that vehicle waste heat could account for up to 300 W m-2 during rush hours over freeways. In another study, Hart & Sailor (2009) used in situ measurements in Portland, OR to evaluate spatial variability of air temperatures on urban roadways. They found that air masses near major roadways are some of the warmest in the region. Although some of the warming is attributed to pavement characteristics (imperviousness, low albedo), an average increase of 1.3 C was observed on weekdays relative to weekends along roadways. The authors offer increased weekday traffic density and building use as the likely contributors to this discrepancy. These previous studies indicates that vehicle related waste heat could be an important consideration in the urban energy balance. If significant, there may exist viable strategies to reduce anthropogenic waste heat from urban vehicle travel by increasing the fleet fuel economy and shifting to electric vehicles. This could offer cooling in urban areas around roadways were pedestrians are often found.

The American Meteorological Society (2012) has said that anthropogenic waste heat may contribute \u201c15 \u2013 50 W/m2 to the local heat balance, and several hundred W/m2 in the center of large cities in cold climates and industrial areas.\u201d\\n\\nAnthropogenic waste heat from urban vehicle travel may be a notable contributor to the urban heat balance and the urban heat island effect, but little research has quantified and explored how changes in vehicle travel may influence local climates. Even with recent rapid improvements to engine efficiencies, modern automobiles still convert small amounts of fuel to useful energy. Typically, around two-thirds of energy from fuel in internal combustion engine vehicles is lost as waste heat through exhaust and coolant (Hsiao et al. 2010; Yu & Chau 2009; Saidur et al. 2009; Endo et al. 2007), and as much as 80% of fuel energy can be lost to waste heat under poor conditions (Orr et al. 2016). In addition, combustion of fuel generates water vapor and air pollution which may also affect the urban climate. Figure 1 displays where a typical combustion engine\u2019s fuel energy is used and lost. There has been little research that quantifies the influence of vehicle travel on urban anthropogenic waste heat. According to Sailor and Lu (2004), most cities have peak anthropogenic waste heat values between 30 and 60 W m-2 (averaged across city) and heating from vehicles could make up as much as 62% of the total in summer months. Additionally, they found that vehicle waste heat could account for up to 300 W m-2 during rush hours over freeways. In another study, Hart & Sailor (2009) used in situ measurements in Portland, OR to evaluate spatial variability of air temperatures on urban roadways. They found that air masses near major roadways are some of the warmest in the region. Although some of the warming is attributed to pavement characteristics (imperviousness, low albedo), an average increase of 1.3 C was observed on weekdays relative to weekends along roadways. The authors offer increased weekday traffic density and building use as the likely contributors to this discrepancy. These previous studies indicates that vehicle related waste heat could be an important consideration in the urban energy balance. If significant, there may exist viable strategies to reduce anthropogenic waste heat from urban vehicle travel by increasing the fleet fuel economy and shifting to electric vehicles.

Infrastructure are facing multiple challenges including inflexible physical assets, unstable and insufficient funding, maturation, utilization, increasing interdependencies, climate change, social and environmental awareness, changes in coupled technology systems, lack of transdisciplinary expertise, geopolitical security, and wicked complexity. These challenges are interrelated and several produce non-stationary effects. Successful infrastructure in the twenty-first century will need to be flexible and agile. Drawing from other industries, we provide recommendations for competencies to realize flexibility and agility: roadmapping, focus on software over hardware, resilience-based thinking, compatibility, connectivity, and modularity of components, organic and change-oriented management, and transdisciplinary education.

7,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,Decling Car Use in a Megacity: Exploring the Drivers of Peak Car including Infrastructure Saturation,36773,,"Fraser, Andrew (Author) || Chester, Mikhail (Author)",,,"There is increasing evidence that vehicle travel in developed countries may have peaked, contradicting many historical travel demand forecasts. The underlying causes of this peaking are still under debate and there has been a mobilization of research, largely focused at national scales, to study the explanatory drivers. There is, however, a dearth of research focused at the metropolitan scale where transportation policy and planning are frequently decided. Using Los Angeles County, California, as a case study, we investigate the Peak Car theory and whether social, economic, and technical factors, including roadways that have become saturated at times, may be contributing to changes in travel behavior. After peaking in 2002, vehicle travel in Los Angeles County declined by 3.4 billion (or 4.1%) by 2010. The effects of changing fuel prices, fuel economy, population growth, increased utilization of alternate transportation modes, changes in driver demographics, income, and freight are first assessed. It is possible, and likely, that these factors alone explain the reduction in travel. However, the growth in congestion raises questions of how a constricting supply of roadway network capacity may contribute to travel behavior changes. There have been no studies that have directly assessed how the maturing supply of infrastructure coupled with increasing demand affect travel behavior. We explore regional and urban factors in Los Angeles to provide insight into the drivers of Peak Car at city scales where the majority of travel occurs. The results show that a majority of the decline in VMT in Los Angeles can be attributed the rising fuel prices during the 2000s. While overall roadway network capacity is not yet a limiting factor for vehicle travel there is some evidence that suggests that congestion along certain corridors may be shifting some automobile travel to alternatives. The results also suggest that the relative impact of any factor on travel demand is likely to vary from one locale to another and Peak Car analysis across large geographic areas obscures the nuisances of travel behavior at a local scale.",,,ASU-SSEBE-CESEM-2016-RPR-002|Stock Number,,,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2016-03-12 22:48:26.793451+00:00,2018-06-21 18:45:59.593716+00:00,1,,,36773.0,,"Fraser, Andrew|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2006014802","Chester, Mikhail Vin|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014005295",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

The oversized, deteriorating, and underfunded water provision system has been steadily accruing debt for the water utility since population began to decrease in the 1950’s. As a result, the utility has instated rate increases and aggressive water shut off policies for non-paying residents.

In this report, I analyze possible solutions to the water crisis from both the water utility and resident perspectives. Since all utility management solutions have very serious limitations on either side of the argument, I have chosen a set of technologies to consider as a part of an impact mitigation plan that can provide alternative sources of water for the people who no longer can rely on municipal water. I additionally propose an adaptive management plan to evaluate the effects of using these technologies in the long-term.

Furthermore, the deployment of government-sponsored cooling centers is not based on the location of existing cooling resources (residential air conditioning and air conditioned public space), raising questions of the equitability of access to heat refuges. Using Los Angeles County, California and Maricopa County, Arizona (whose county seat is Phoenix) we explore the distribution of private and public cooling resources and access inequities at the household level. We do this by evaluating the presence of in-home air conditioning and developing a walking-based accessibility measure to air conditioned public space using a combined cumulative opportunities-gravity approach. We find significant inequities in the distribution of residential air conditioning across both regions which are largely attributable to building age and inter/intra-regional climate differences. There are also regional disparities in walkable access to public cooled space. At average walking speeds, we find that official cooling centers are only accessible to a small fraction of households (3% in Los Angeles, 2% in Maricopa) while a significantly higher number of households (80% in Los Angeles, 39% in Maricopa) have access to at least one other type of public cooling resource which includes libraries and commercial establishments. Aggregated to a neighborhood level, we find that there are areas within each region where access to cooled space (either public or private) is limited which may increase the health risks associated with heat.",,,ASU-SSEBE-CESEM-2015-RPR-002|Stock Number,,,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2015-08-24 18:34:58.677096+00:00,2018-06-21 18:45:59.534958+00:00,0,,,34956.0,,"Fraser, Andrew|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2006014802","Chester, Mikhail Vin|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014005295","Eisenman, David","Hondula, David","Pincentl, Stephanie","English, Paul|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no96035964",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

Exposure to extreme heat can result in heat related-illness such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke as well as heat-related death. Furthermore, exposure can exacerbate preexisting chronic conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases contributing to additional emergency room visits, hospitalizations and premature death. (Berko et al., 2014; Luber and McGeehin, 2008). Although exposure to extreme heat is preventable, it is a leading weather-related cause of mortality worldwide. In the United States exposure to extreme heat resulted in 3,332 deaths between 2006-2001 (Berko et al., 2014). It is estimated that the 2003 European heatwave contributed to 70,000 excess mortality events across sixteen countries (Robine et al., 2008). In May 2015, extreme heat was blamed for 2,500 deaths in India where daily maximum temperatures exceeded 47 Co (Das, 2015). General circulation models predict that frequency, duration, and severity of heatwaves will increase consequently intensifying the risks associated with exposure in the future (Karl and Melillo, 2009; Solomon et al., 2011). In order to mitigate future heat-related morbidity and mortality regional interventions which diminish exposure are needed. \\n\\nDue to growing health concerns, city and county public health agencies have developed and introduced heatwave-response programs to mitigate the health-related risks associated with prolonged periods of unusually high temperatures (Uejio et al., 2011). Collectively these programs aim to prevent heat-related mortality and morbidity through targeted programs that warn individuals of impending heatwaves (announcements via television, radio and social media), highlight risks associated with exposure, provide recommendations for staying cool, and raise awareness for individuals at greater risk (Bernard and McGeehin, 2004). While extreme heat can adversely affect the health of anyone, there are population subsets which are particularly vulnerable, including the elderly and individuals with underlying medical conditions (Stafoggia et al., 2006).  A lack of access to air-conditioning (AC) has been identified as a significant factor associated with heat-related morbidity and mortality (Blum et al., 1998). Consequently, many of these programs also establish a network of cooling centers, designated public air-conditioned spaces, which operate during heatwaves to provide cooled space for those without access to air-conditioning in their own residences or those who can\u2019t afford to use air-conditioning. Official cooling center networks include a mix of community centers, senior citizen centers, libraries, religious/service organizations, and government buildings. While there is limited research available on the effectiveness of excessive heat management plans as a whole, even less is known about designated public cooling centers and whether they effectively serve potentially vulnerable populations as a mitigation strategy for coping with extreme heat (Ebi et al., 2004; Hondula et al., 2015). \\n\\nWhere much of the research on the health related impacts of heatwaves has focused on socio-demographic vulnerabilities (Harlan et al., 2006; Reid et al., 2009; Stafoggia et al., 2006; Uejio et al., 2011), we explore infrastructure characteristics, such as in home AC and publically available cooled space, that may mitigate the negative health impacts of heat exposure. Since it is currently unclear whether cities prioritize infrastructure and public resources with regard to rising urban temperatures, more information is needed to develop effective strategies addressing public health during heatwaves. To effectively address public health needs, cities must also consider differences between privately-held resources and public accommodations. Privately-held resources are those that offer access to cooled space to a restricted group of people while public cooling resources are those potentially open to all. In home air-conditioning is the primary example of a privately-held cooling resource therefore establishing which households within a city have air-conditioning in their homes could be used to direct public resources, including the deployment of cooling centers, to areas where households lack the ability to maintain a cooled space. In addition to designated cooling centers, there are potentially other public spaces within communities which also provide respite from extreme temperatures and improve a community\u2019s ability to cope with heatwaves. \\n\\nIn order to examine public and private cooling accommodations, our study explores private cooling disparities and public cooling accommodations at the household scale using two regions in the American Southwest: Los Angeles County, California and Maricopa County, Arizona (simply referred to as Los Angeles and Maricopa hereafter). These areas encompass two of the largest metropolitan regions in the southwestern United States, both in terms of population and land area. In addition to demographics considerations, Los Angeles and Maricopa necessitate study because general circulation models predict increases in both annual average temperature and the frequency and severity of heatwaves in these locales over the next 75 years (Bartos and Chester, 2015). Despite similarities in the heat increases expected in both areas, interregional climate and topography differences make addressing climate change and heatwaves unique to each location. In Maricopa, extreme heat is a regular occurrence: daily maximum temperatures average 40 C or more for an extended period each summer lasting from June 15 to August 27. In contrast, extreme heat occurs more periodically in Los Angeles (Smith et al., 2013). Although the nature of extreme heat is quite different between these two locations, high temperatures have been associated with elevated risks of adverse heat-health outcomes for both regions (Anderson and Bell, 2009; Petitti et al., 2015; Sheridan et al., 2012). \\n\\nIn response to mounting concerns of exposure to heat, both regions have established a network of official cooling centers, which are active during the summer months. Moreover, heterogeneous land use characteristics result in an uneven distribution of these cooling centers and other potential public cooling resources relative to individual households. The goal of this research is to highlight the availability of in home AC and accessibility of public cooling resources for individual households in order to inform the development of future heatwave-response programs that could more effectively target areas within each region which may be a greater risk during heatwaves.'}], 'identifier': [{'type': 'Stock Number', 'value': 'ASU-SSEBE-CESEM-2015-RPR-002'}], 'title': ['Household Accessibility to Heat Refuges']}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 31, ""history_date"": ""2016-09-22T23:01:15.122Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""~"", ""history_user"": null}}, {""model"": ""repo.historicalitem"", ""pk"": 195407, ""fields"": {""id"": 34956, ""created"": ""2015-08-24T18:34:58.677Z"", ""modified"": ""2015-09-07T23:41:27.075Z"", ""handle_registered"": true, ""label"": ""Household Accessibility to Heat Refuges"", ""item_enabled"": true, ""item_status"": 2, ""metadata"": ""{'rights': 'All Rights Reserved', 'contributor': [{'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Andrew', 'last': 'Fraser'}, {'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Mikhail', 'last': 'Chester'}, {'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'David', 'last': 'Eisenman'}, {'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'David', 'last': 'Hondula'}, {'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Stephanie', 'last': 'Pincetl'}, {'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Paul', 'last': 'English'}], 'description': [{'type': 'abstract', 'value': 'Extreme heat is a serious threat to public health.

Exposure to extreme heat can result in heat related-illness such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke as well as heat-related death. Furthermore, exposure can exacerbate preexisting chronic conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases contributing to additional emergency room visits, hospitalizations and premature death. (Berko et al., 2014; Luber and McGeehin, 2008). Although exposure to extreme heat is preventable, it is a leading weather-related cause of mortality worldwide. In the United States exposure to extreme heat resulted in 3,332 deaths between 2006-2001 (Berko et al., 2014). It is estimated that the 2003 European heatwave contributed to 70,000 excess mortality events across sixteen countries (Robine et al., 2008). In May 2015, extreme heat was blamed for 2,500 deaths in India where daily maximum temperatures exceeded 47 Co (Das, 2015). General circulation models predict that frequency, duration, and severity of heatwaves will increase consequently intensifying the risks associated with exposure in the future (Karl and Melillo, 2009; Solomon et al., 2011). In order to mitigate future heat-related morbidity and mortality regional interventions which diminish exposure are needed. \\n\\nDue to growing health concerns, city and county public health agencies have developed and introduced heatwave-response programs to mitigate the health-related risks associated with prolonged periods of unusually high temperatures (Uejio et al., 2011). Collectively these programs aim to prevent heat-related mortality and morbidity through targeted programs that warn individuals of impending heatwaves (announcements via television, radio and social media), highlight risks associated with exposure, provide recommendations for staying cool, and raise awareness for individuals at greater risk (Bernard and McGeehin, 2004). While extreme heat can adversely affect the health of anyone, there are population subsets which are particularly vulnerable, including the elderly and individuals with underlying medical conditions (Stafoggia et al., 2006).  A lack of access to air-conditioning (AC) has been identified as a significant factor associated with heat-related morbidity and mortality (Blum et al., 1998). Consequently, many of these programs also establish a network of cooling centers, designated public air-conditioned spaces, which operate during heatwaves to provide cooled space for those without access to air-conditioning in their own residences or those who can\u2019t afford to use air-conditioning. Official cooling center networks include a mix of community centers, senior citizen centers, libraries, religious/service organizations, and government buildings. While there is limited research available on the effectiveness of excessive heat management plans as a whole, even less is known about designated public cooling centers and whether they effectively serve potentially vulnerable populations as a mitigation strategy for coping with extreme heat (Ebi et al., 2004; Hondula et al., 2015). \\n\\nWhere much of the research on the health related impacts of heatwaves has focused on socio-demographic vulnerabilities (Harlan et al., 2006; Reid et al., 2009; Stafoggia et al., 2006; Uejio et al., 2011), we explore infrastructure characteristics, such as in home AC and publically available cooled space, that may mitigate the negative health impacts of heat exposure. Since it is currently unclear whether cities prioritize infrastructure and public resources with regard to rising urban temperatures, more information is needed to develop effective strategies addressing public health during heatwaves. To effectively address public health needs, cities must also consider differences between privately-held resources and public accommodations. Privately-held resources are those that offer access to cooled space to a restricted group of people while public cooling resources are those potentially open to all. In home air-conditioning is the primary example of a privately-held cooling resource therefore establishing which households within a city have air-conditioning in their homes could be used to direct public resources, including the deployment of cooling centers, to areas where households lack the ability to maintain a cooled space. In addition to designated cooling centers, there are potentially other public spaces within communities which also provide respite from extreme temperatures and improve a community\u2019s ability to cope with heatwaves. \\n\\nIn order to examine public and private cooling accommodations, our study explores private cooling disparities and public cooling accommodations at the household scale using two regions in the American Southwest: Los Angeles County, California and Maricopa County, Arizona (simply referred to as Los Angeles and Maricopa hereafter). These areas encompass two of the largest metropolitan regions in the southwestern United States, both in terms of population and land area. In addition to demographics considerations, Los Angeles and Maricopa necessitate study because general circulation models predict increases in both annual average temperature and the frequency and severity of heatwaves in these locales over the next 75 years (Bartos and Chester, 2015). Despite similarities in the heat increases expected in both areas, interregional climate and topography differences make addressing climate change and heatwaves unique to each location. In Maricopa, extreme heat is a regular occurrence: daily maximum temperatures average 40 C or more for an extended period each summer lasting from June 15 to August 27. In contrast, extreme heat occurs more periodically in Los Angeles (Smith et al., 2013). Although the nature of extreme heat is quite different between these two locations, high temperatures have been associated with elevated risks of adverse heat-health outcomes for both regions (Anderson and Bell, 2009; Petitti et al., 2015; Sheridan et al., 2012). \\n\\nIn response to mounting concerns of exposure to heat, both regions have established a network of official cooling centers, which are active during the summer months.

Finally, in making a case for emergentism, the paper concludes that fMRI cannot really tell us as much about ourselves as we had hoped.

22,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,Methodology for Estimating Electricity Generation Vulnerability to Climate Change Using a Physically-based Modelling System,25404,,"Bartos, Matthew (Author) || Chester, Mikhail (Author)",,,"In recent years, concerns have grown over the risks posed by climate change on the U.S. electricity grid. The availability of water resources is integral to the production of electric power, and droughts are expected to become more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting over the course of the twenty-first century. The American Southwest, in particular, is expected to experience large deficits in streamflow. Studies on the Colorado River anticipate streamflow declines of 20-45% by 2050. Other climactic shifts—such as higher water and air temperatures—may also adversely affect power generation. As extreme weather becomes more common, better methods are needed to assess the impact of climate change on power generation. This study uses a physically-based modeling system to assess the vulnerability of power infrastructure in the Southwestern United States at a policy-relevant scale.<br/><br/> Thermoelectric power—which satisfies a majority of U.S. electricity demand—is vulnerable to drought. Thermoelectric power represents the backbone of the U.S. power sector, accounting for roughly 91% of generation. Thermoelectric power also accounts for roughly 39% of all water withdrawals in the U.S.—roughly equivalent to the amount of water used for agriculture. Water use in power plants is primarily dictated by the needs of the cooling system. During the power generation process, thermoelectric power plants build up waste heat, which must be discharged in order for the generation process to continue. Traditionally, water is used for this purpose, because it is safe, plentiful, and can absorb a large amount of heat. However, when water availability is constrained, power generation may also be adversely affected. Thermoelectric power plants are particularly susceptible to changes in streamflow and water temperature. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by environmental regulations, which govern both the amount of water withdrawn, and the temperatures of the water discharged. In 2003, extreme drought and heat impaired the generating capacity of more than 30 European nuclear power plants, which were unable to comply with environmental regulations governing discharge temperatures. Similarly, many large base-load thermoelectric facilities in the Southeastern United States were threatened by a prolonged drought in 2007 and 2008. During this period, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reduced generation at several facilities, and one major facility was shut down entirely. To meet demand, the TVA was forced to purchase electricity from the grid, causing electricity prices to rise.<br/><br/>Although thermoelectric power plants currently produce most of the electric power consumed in the United States, other sources of power are also vulnerable to changes in climate. Renewables are largely dependent on natural resources like rain, wind, and sunlight. As the quantity and distribution of these resources begins to change, renewable generation is also likely to be affected. Hydroelectric dams represent the largest source of renewable energy currently in use throughout the United States. Under drought conditions, when streamflow attenuates and reservoir levels drop, hydroelectric plants are unable to operate at normal capacity. In 2001, severe drought in California and the Pacific Northwest restricted hydroelectric power generation, causing a steep increase in electricity prices. Although blackouts and brownouts were largely avoided, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council estimated a regional economic impact of roughly $2.5 to $6 billion. In addition to hydroelectric power, it has also been theorized that solar energy resources may also be susceptible to predicted increases in surface temperature and atmospheric albedo. One study predicts that solar facilities in the Southwestern U.S. may suffer losses of 2-5%.<br/><br/>The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which climate change may impact power generation in the Southwestern United States. This analysis will focus on the Western Interconnection, which comprises the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico and Texas. First, climactic and hydrologic parameters relevant to power generation are identified for five types of generation technologies. A series of functional relationships are developed such that impacts to power generation can be estimated directly from changes in certain meteorological and hydrological parameters. Next, climate forcings from the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble are used as inputs to a physically-based modeling system (consisting of a hydrological model, an offline routing model, and a one-dimensional stream temperature model). The modeling system is used to estimate changes in climactic and hydrologic parameters relevant to electricity generation for various generation technologies. Climactic and hydrologic parameters are then combined with the functional relationships developed in the first step to estimate impacts to power generation over the twenty-first century.",,,ASU-CESEM-2014-WPS-002|Stock Number,,,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2014-07-21 19:38:05.045635+00:00,2018-06-21 18:45:59.447824+00:00,1,,,25404.0,,"Bartos, Matthew","Chester, Mikhail Vin|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014005295",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

In 2001, severe drought in California and the Pacific Northwest restricted hydroelectric power generation, causing a steep increase in electricity prices. Although blackouts and brownouts were largely avoided, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council estimated a regional economic impact of roughly $2.5 to $6 billion. In addition to hydroelectric power, it has also been theorized that solar energy resources may also be susceptible to predicted increases in surface temperature and atmospheric albedo. One study predicts that solar facilities in the Southwestern U.S. may suffer losses of 2-5%.\\n\\nThe aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which climate change may impact power generation in the Southwestern United States. This analysis will focus on the Western Interconnection, which comprises the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico and Texas. First, climactic and hydrologic parameters relevant to power generation are identified for five types of generation technologies. A series of functional relationships are developed such that impacts to power generation can be estimated directly from changes in certain meteorological and hydrological parameters. Next, climate forcings from the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble are used as inputs to a physically-based modeling system (consisting of a hydrological model, an offline routing model, and a one-dimensional stream temperature model). The modeling system is used to estimate changes in climactic and hydrologic parameters relevant to electricity generation for various generation technologies. Climactic and hydrologic parameters are then combined with the functional relationships developed in the first step to estimate impacts to power generation over the twenty-first century.'}], 'identifier': [{'type': 'Stock Number', 'value': 'ASU-CESEM-2014-WPS-002'}], 'rights': 'All Rights Reserved', 'contributor': [{'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Matthew', 'last': 'Bartos'}, {'roles': ['Author'], 'rest': 'Mikhail', 'last': 'Chester'}], 'title': ['Methodology for Estimating Electricity Generation Vulnerability to Climate Change Using a Physically-based Modelling System']}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 31, ""history_date"": ""2014-07-21T19:38:05.110Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": null}}]"

This LCA analyzed the impacts associated from cradle-to-grave processes of one bottle of Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion, including raw material extraction, raw material processing, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, use and end-of-life of both the lotion itself as well as the bottle. To successfully propose end-of-life management techniques, three different disposal options were analyzed: landfill disposal, incineration and recycling. All processes included in the system boundary were compared across three main midpoint impact categories: Fossil depletion, Freshwater depletion and Global Warming Potential. Results showed that transportation of the product outweighed all other processes in regard to the three impact categories. When all processes but transportation were considered, results showed that raw material extraction and processing was the significant contributor to the three impact categories. This LCA therefore proposes that Aveeno take advantage of local products to limit the need for excessive transportation. Furthermore, sustainable forms of transportation could be used to offset the product’s overall environmental impacts. In regard to end-of-life disposal options, Aveeno could market recycling techniques to push forth the reuse of their plastic bottle.

31,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,Assessing Future Extreme Heat Events at Intra-urban Scales: A Comparative Study of Phoenix and Los Angeles,25228,Urban || Cities || Climate Change || Greenhouse Gas Emissions || Extreme Heat,"Bartos, Matthew (Author) || Chester, Mikhail (Author)",,2014-06-12,"Already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States, extreme heat events (EHEs) are expected to occur with greater frequency, duration and intensity over the next century. However, not all populations are affected equally. Risk factors for heat mortality—including age, race, income level, and infrastructure characteristics—often vary by geospatial location. While traditional epidemiological studies sometimes account for social risk factors, they rarely account for intra-urban variability in meteorological characteristics, or for the interaction between social and meteorological risks. This study aims to develop estimates of EHEs at an intra-urban scale for two major metropolitan areas in the Southwest: Maricopa County (Arizona) and Los Angeles County (California). EHEs are identified at a 1/8-degree (12 km) spatial resolution using an algorithm that detects prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures.  Downscaled temperature projections from three general circulation models (GCMs) are analyzed under three relative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. Over the next century, EHEs are found to increase by 340-1800% in Maricopa County, and by 150-840% in Los Angeles County. Frequency of future EHEs is primarily driven by greenhouse gas concentrations, with the greatest number of EHEs occurring under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Intra-urban variation in EHEs is also found to be significant. Within Maricopa County, “high risk” regions exhibit 4.5 times the number of EHE days compared to “low risk” regions; within Los Angeles County, this ratio is 15 to 1.<br/><br/>Project website: http://www.urbantransitions.org/extremeheat/",,,ASU-CESEM-2014-WPS-001|Stock Number,Working Paper Series,,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2014-06-12 19:27:34.896087+00:00,2018-06-21 18:45:59.356067+00:00,1,,,25228.0,,"Bartos, Matthew","Chester, Mikhail Vin|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014005295",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

37,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Reused Versus Disposable Dental Burs,17490,Dental Burs || Life Cycle Assessment,"Unger, Scott (Author)",,2013-05,"Healthcare infection control has led to increased utilization of disposable medical devices, which has subsequently led to increased adverse environmental effects attributed to healthcare and its supply chain. In dental practice, the dental bur is a commonly used instrument that can either be reused or used once and then disposed. To evaluate the disparities in environmental impacts of disposable and reusable dental burs, a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed. The comparative LCA evaluated a reusable dental bur (specifically, a 2.00mm Internal Irrigation Pilot Drill) reused 30 instances versus 30 identical burs used as disposables. The LCA methodology was performed using framework described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 series. Sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to ultrasonic and autoclave loading. Findings from this research showed that when the ultrasonic and autoclave are loaded optimally, reusable burs had 40% less of an environmental impact than burs used on a disposable basis. When the ultrasonic and autoclave were loaded to 66% capacity, there was an environmental breakeven point between disposable and reusable burs. Eutrophication, carcinogenic impacts, non-carcinogenic impacts, and acidification were limited when cleaning equipment (i.e., ultrasonic and autoclave) were optimally loaded. Additionally, the bur’s packaging materials contributed more negative environmental impacts than the production and use of the bur itself. Therefore, less materially-intensive packaging should be used. Specifically, the glass fiber reinforced plastic casing should be substituted for a material with a reduced environmental footprint.",,eng,SSEBE-CESEM-2013-CPR-011|Stock Number,Course Project Report Series,Text,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2013-06-01 0:00:53.743184+00:00,2018-06-21 18:45:59.294158+00:00,1,,,17490.0,,"Unger, Scott",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

40,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,An Attributional Life Cycle Assessment of Hemcrete,17487,Hemcrete || Life Cycle Assessment,"Dolins, Sigma (Author) || Guiley, Keith (Author) || Poletti, Joseph (Author) || Stafford, Nicholas (Author)",,2013-05,"Hemcrete is an alternative, environmentally‐friendly building material gaining adherents in Great Britain<br/>and other European countries. It is an attractive choice as a building material because it is made from a renewable<br/>resource, hemp, a hardy plant that is a close, but non‐hallucinogenic relative of marijuana. This plant is relatively<br/>easy to cultivate, requires little in the way of pesticides or fertilizers, and almost all parts can be used for various<br/>products from paper to textiles to food.<br/><br/>Hemcrete is made from a mixture of lime, water, and the fibrous outer portion of the hemp plant called<br/>the “hurd” or “shive”. When mixed, it is worked and placed much like conventional concrete ‐ hence the name.<br/>However, that is where the similarities with concrete end. Hemcrete is not comparable to concrete on a strength<br/>basis, and is better described as an alternative insulation product. When built into walls of sufficient thickness,<br/>Hemcrete offers high thermal efficiency, and has strong claims to being carbon negative. The purpose of this study<br/>was to evaluate this claim of carbon negativity, and to compare these environmentally friendly qualities against<br/>conventional fiberglass batt insulation. Our model was constructed using two identically sized “walls” measuring<br/>eight feet square by one foot in depth, one insulated using Hemcrete, and the other using fiberglass.<br/><br/>Our study focused on three areas: water usage, cost, and carbon dioxide emissions. We chose water<br/>usage because we wanted to determine the feasibility of using Hemcrete in the Phoenix metropolitan region,<br/>where water is a troubled resource. Secondly, we wished to evaluate the claim on carbon negativity, so CO2<br/>equivalents throughout the production process were measured.

This plant is relatively\\neasy to cultivate, requires little in the way of pesticides or fertilizers, and almost all parts can be used for various\\nproducts from paper to textiles to food.\\n\\nHemcrete is made from a mixture of lime, water, and the fibrous outer portion of the hemp plant called\\nthe \u201churd\u201d or \u201cshive\u201d. When mixed, it is worked and placed much like conventional concrete \u2010 hence the name.\\nHowever, that is where the similarities with concrete end.

46,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,Producing a Legally Autonomous Adult: Foster Care as a System Expansion in Life-Cycle Assessment,17479,Society || Legal Autonomy || Child Protective Services || Life Cycle Assessment,"Cazel-Jahn, Angela (Author)",,2013-05,"There is no ’typical’ production process for Legally Autonomous Adults (LAD). However, some very general inputs and flows can be assumed: Physical, mental, emotional, and social or cultural inputs are provided by primary caregivers throughout the process. LADs in Arizona in the 21st century are produced in small batches. Inputs tend to be provided by consistent sources according to unique values, and the production process does not actually stop cold at the factory gate, but continues on into the next phase.<br/><br/>Sometimes, due to externalities like substance dependence or domestic violence, the original production process either deprives the product of essential inputs or adds toxic inputs, causing damage. The damage can carry forward into the next phases, or even be so severe that the production process is terminated. When there is a risk of such damage, then the product – the child – is removed from his original production system, taken into the custody of a state-run institution (Child Protective Services), and placed in foster care.<br/><br/>LADs who have experienced a foster care intervention as part of their production process are less likely to have that obligatory property of Legal Autonomy, and more likely to have obligatory properties that are detrimental to society at large. Omitting other variables, they have higher rates of incarceration, homelessness, and substance abuse than LADs who have not been in out-of-home foster care. The financial and societal costs of those dependencies are imposed on the same stakeholders whose efforts and contributions make the foster care system possible.<br/><br/>CPS removal triggers a system expansion that expends energy and resources in an attempt to compensate for the missing inputs and to mitigate the toxic inputs, if any, that the child’s family was adding. In a material production system, it seems illogical to construct a complex system expansion which predictably results in products lacking their most important obligatory property. That contradiction was the impetus for this paper.<br/><br/>The goal of this life cycle analysis is to visualize that system expansion. Then, the project seeks to quantify and compare the difference between this system expansion and the generalized original process, in units of dollars per LAD.

In a material production system, it seems illogical to construct a complex system expansion which predictably results in products lacking their most important obligatory property. That contradiction was the impetus for this paper.\\n\\nThe goal of this life cycle analysis is to visualize that system expansion. Then, the project seeks to quantify and compare the difference between this system expansion and the generalized original process, in units of dollars per LAD. Finally, the project assesses the statistical impacts of the system expansion on LADs, and describes further impacts of these LADs on society at large.'}], 'identifier': [{'type': 'Stock Number', 'value': 'SSEBE-CESEM-2013-CPR-001'}], 'rights': [{'type': 'all-rights-reserved'}], 'language': ['eng']}"", ""embargo_date"": null, ""collection"": 31, ""history_date"": ""2013-05-31T22:20:07.158Z"", ""history_change_reason"": null, ""history_type"": ""+"", ""history_user"": null}}]"

To better inform decision-makers, this project evaluates the decision to construct and operate public transportation systems and the expected energy and environmental benefits over continued automobile use. The public transit systems are selected based on screening criteria. Initial screening included advanced implementation (5 to 10 years so change in ridership could be observed), similar geographic regions to ensure consistency of analysis parameters, common transit agencies or authorities to ensure a consistent management culture, and modes reflecting large infrastructure investments to provide an opportunity for robust life cycle assessment of large impact components. An in-depth screening process including consideration of data availability, project age, energy consumption, infrastructure information, access and egress information, and socio-demographic characteristics was used as the second filter.  The results of this selection process led to Los Angeles Metro’s Orange and Gold lines.<br/><br/>In this study, the life cycle assessment framework is used to evaluate energy inputs and emissions of greenhouse gases, particulate matter (10 and 2.5 microns), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide. For the Orange line, Gold line, and competing automobile trip, an analysis system boundary that includes vehicle, infrastructure, and energy production components is specified. Life cycle energy use and emissions inventories are developed for each mode considering direct (vehicle operation), ancillary (non-vehicle operation including vehicle maintenance, infrastructure construction, infrastructure operation, etc.), and supply chain processes and services. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, the inventories are linked to their potential for respiratory impacts and smog formation, and the time it takes to payback in the lifetime of each transit system.<br/><br/>Results show that for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, the inclusion of life cycle components increases the footprint between 42% and 91% from vehicle propulsion exclusively. Conventional air emissions show much more dramatic increases highlighting the effectiveness of “tailpipe” environmental policy. Within the life cycle, vehicle operation is often small compared to other components. Particulate matter emissions increase between 270% and 5400%. Sulfur dioxide emissions increase by several orders of magnitude for the on road modes due to electricity use throughout the life cycle. NOx emissions increase between 31% and 760% due to supply chain truck and rail transport. VOC emissions increase due to infrastructure material production and placement by 420% and 1500%. CO emissions increase by between 20% and 320%. The dominating contributions from life cycle components show that the decision to build an infrastructure and operate a transportation mode in Los Angeles has impacts far outside of the city and region.

City and county officials have developed aggressive strategies for the future of passenger transportation in the metropolitan area, and are determined to move away from a “business as usual” future. This project starts with current-state source data from a life-cycle comparison of urban transportation systems (Chester, Horvath, & Madanat, 2010), and carries the inventoried emissions and energy usage through by way of published future scenarios for San Francisco. From the extrapolated calculations of future emissions/energy, the implied mix of transportation modes can be backed out of the numbers. Five scenarios are evaluated, from “business as usual” through very ambitious “healthy environment” goals. The results show that when planners and policymakers craft specific goals or strategies for a location or government, those targets, even if met, are unlikely to result in the intended physical outcomes. City and state governments would be wise to support broad strategy goals (like 20% GHG reduction) with prioritized specifics that can inform real projects leading to the goals (for instance, add 5 miles of bike path per year through 2020, or remove 5 parking garages and replace them with transit depots).

61,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,Algae Growth for Lipid Production,13518,,"Barr, William (Author) || Hottle, Troy (Author)",,2012-05,"This study analyzes the feasibility of using algae cultivated from wastewater effluent to produce a biodiesel feedstock. The goal was to determine if the energy produced was greater than the operational energy consumed without consideration to constructing the system as well as the emissions and economic value associated with the process. Four scenarios were created; 1) high-lipid, dry extraction, 2) high-lipid, wet extraction, 3) low-lipid, dry extraction and, 4) low-lipid, wet extraction. In all cases the system required more energy than it produced. In high lipid scenarios the energy produced is close to the energy consumed and with minor improvements in technology or accounting for coproducts a positive net energy balance may be achieved. In the low lipid scenarios the energy balance is too negative to be considered feasible. Therefore the lipid content affects the decision to implement algae<br/>cultivation. The dry extraction and the wet extraction both require some level of mechanical drying and this makes the two methods yield similar results in terms of the energy analysis. Therefore the extraction method does not dramatically affect the decision for implementing algae-based oil production from an energetic standpoint. The economic value of the oil in both high lipid scenarios results in a net profit despite the negative net energy. Emission calculations resulted in avoiding a significant amount of CO2 for high lipid scenarios but not for the low lipid scenarios. The CO2 avoided does not account for non-lipid biomass and so this number is an underestimation of the final CO2 avoided from the end products. While the term CO2 avoided has been used for this study it should be noted that this CO2 would be emitted upon use as a fuel source. These emissions, however, are not “new” CO2 because it has already been emitted and is being captured and recycled. Currently, literature is very divisive on the<br/>lipid content present in algae and this study shows that lipid content has a tremendous affect on energy and emissions impacts. The type of algae that can grow in wastewater effluent also should be investigated as well as the conditions that promote high lipid accumulation. The dewatering phase must be improved as it is extremely energy intensive and dominates the operational energy balance. In order to compete, wet extraction must have a much more significant effect on the drying phase and must avoid the use of the human toxicants, methanol and chloroform. Additionally, while the construction phase was beyond the scope of this project it may be a critical aspect in determining the feasibility these systems. Future research in this field should focus on lipid production, optimizing the belt dryer or finding a different method of dewatering, and allocating the coproducts.",,eng,SSEBE-CESEM-2012-CPR-007|Stock Number,Course Project Report Series,Text,,,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,All Rights Reserved,Public,,2012-05-16 17:27:56.902297+00:00,2018-06-21 18:45:59.034814+00:00,1,,,13518.0,,"Barr, William|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n77011594","Hottle, Troy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arizona State University.

66,31.0,Center for Earth Systems Engineering and Management,A Consequential Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Seitan and Beef,13387,,"Berardy, Andrew (Author)",,2012-05,"Meaningful sustainable consumption patterns require informed consumers who understand the actual impact of their actions on a quantitative and tangible basis.  Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool well suited to achieving this goal, but has only been superficially applied to the analysis of plant-based diets.  This analysis looks at a common component of plant-based meat alternatives: a wheat-based protein known as seitan, which is a common substitute for beef.  A comparative consequential analysis shows the overall change in environmental impact when 1000 servings of seitan displace 1000 servings of beef.  The functional unit for comparison is one serving of seitan or one serving of beef and the system boundaries include production but not distribution, consumption or disposal.  Life cycles are created for seitan and beef in the LCA modeling software SimaPro and an analysis is run using the Eco-indicator 99 methodology.  The beef life cycle is created using complete existing LCA data, while the seitan life cycle is created using LCA data for constituent materials and processes.  <br/><br/>Findings indicate that beef is much more environmentally impactful than seitan, but the largest difference is found in land use change.  Significant data quality and uncertainty issues exist due to the data being incomplete or not representative for US processes and the use of proxy processes to estimate industrial processing.  This analysis is still useful as a screening tool to show rough differences in impact.  It is noted that despite seitan having a lower environmental impact than beef, increasing seitan production will probably have the effect of increasing overall environmental impacts, as beef production is not likely to decrease as a result.  Massive changes in consumer purchase patterns are required before reductions in impact can be expected.
